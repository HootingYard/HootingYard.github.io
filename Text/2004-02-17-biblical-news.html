  <h1>Biblical News</h1>
  <p>During the 1950s, a God-fearing American television producer named Fret D. Chenoweth created a 43-part series called <em>To Smite And Smite Again</em>, a dramatisation of the Old Testament. The novelty of his treatment was that the Biblical stories were set in a modern high school and acted by fresh-faced youngsters with names like Tad, Biff, Chip, Huck &amp; so on. When he died—curiously enough, in the 1958 Munich Air Disaster, surrounded by English footballers—Chenoweth's obituary described him as “the man who put the Chad in Nebuchadnezzar”.</p>
