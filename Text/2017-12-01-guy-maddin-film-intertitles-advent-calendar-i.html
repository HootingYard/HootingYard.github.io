  <p>This year our Advent Calendar features intertitles from the films of Guy Maddin. Here at Hooting Yard, we revere Maddin, the finest living film director and a true original. Many of his short films are available on YouTube, and you are urged to go and watch them at once. His feature films make pretty much everything else in the cinema look impossibly dull and formulaic. Maddin is prolific—I could quite easily have chosen twenty-five different intertitles for this calendar. Perhaps next year …</p>
  <p>Today's intertitle is from <em>Odin's Shield Maiden</em> (2006).</p>
