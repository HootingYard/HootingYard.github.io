  <h1 id="post-12582">Thatcher Bird Comparison Update</h1>
  <p>When Margaret Thatcher died last year, I devoted one of my potsages [sic] for <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/04/a-note-on-the-death-of-margaret-thatcher/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong></em> to the unresolved question of which bird she most closely resembled. I noted that Matthew Parris claimed “she walked like a partridge”, while Jon Snow asserted “she scuttled about like a hen”. Now things have become more complicated. Reading Dominic Sandbrook's <em>Seasons In The Sun&nbsp;: The Battle For Britain 1974–1979</em>, I learn that the <em>Daily Express</em> compared the then-future Prime Minister to “an angry woodpecker”.</p>
