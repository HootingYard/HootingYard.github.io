  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“It was a strange day, the day that I was born. The waves were beating against the lighthouse, and the wind was roaring and raging against everything. Had not the lighthouse been built very firmly into the strong solid rock, it, and all within it, must have been swept into the deep wild sea.” — Mrs O. F. Walton, <em>Saved At Sea</em></p>
