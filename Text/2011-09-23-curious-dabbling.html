  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/09/some-lesser-known-editions-of-the-bible/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week I turn my attention to some lesser-known editions of the Bible, as noted by Isaac Disraeli in his <em><strong><a href="http://www.spamula.net/col/" class="external">Curiosities Of Literature</a></strong></em>. This is a splendid work, highly recommended to Hooting Yard readers. To take just one essay at random, in <strong><em><a href="http://www.spamula.net/col/archives/2005/01/amusements_of_the_learned.html" class="external">Amusements Of The Learned</a></em></strong>, we are told that</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>When Petavius was employed in his <em>Dogma Thealogiea</em>, a work of the most profound and extensive erudition, the great recreation of the learned father was at the end of every second hour, to twirl his chair for five minutes.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Twirling in a seated position wasn't good enough for Cardinal Richelieu. He preferred “violent exercises; and he was once discovered jumping with his servant, to try who could reach the highest side of a wall.”</p>
  <p>Most amusing, perhaps, is the manner in which Baruch Spinoza liked to unwind from his philosophical labours:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>After protracted studies Spinoza, would… unbend his mind by setting spiders to fight each other; he observed their combats with so much interest, that he was often seized with immoderate fits of laughter.</p>
  </blockquote>
