  <p>Over the past week or so, your super soaraway Hooting Yard has been inundated, <em>inundated</em> I tell you!, with spam comments. Usually there are three or four a day, now there are hundreds. What this means is that I cannot be bothered to skim through all the bollocks* to whittle out any genuine comments that are sometimes misdirected down the spam chute. So, if you send a comment and it fails to appear in due time, please either try again or send me an email to let me know.</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM</strong>&nbsp;: * I am reminded that this useful word ought to be spelled in the Beckettian manner, i.e. ballocks.</p>
