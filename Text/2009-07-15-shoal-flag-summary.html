  <h1 id="post-2624">Shoal Flag Summary</h1>
  <p>The blue flag, tatty, at half-mast, indicates to those watching on the shore that a shoal is present just beyond the sandbank a quarter of a mile out. The green flag is displayed when no shoal can be seen from the helicopters.</p>
  <p>It can be difficult to tell blue from green, at certain times of day, even for those without the condition of Daltonism. In milky light, or when a vapour haze descends, the colour of the flag might be blue or green or grey to any but the most acute observer.</p>
  <p>Work has begun on developing more robust dyes for the flags. Some have suggested issuing the watchers on the shore with prismatically-enhanced telescopes. Trained cormorants have also been mentioned in a rogue report, although what role they would play remains sketchy.</p>
  <p>“These are testing times,” said a brigadier with a great personal investment in shoals. He was supported by those who dwell on the sandbank, in cardboard shelters, whose voices are so rarely heard above the din.</p>
  <p>Divers, shellists, and the cadets responsible for the darning of the flags, are due to appear later in the week.</p>
