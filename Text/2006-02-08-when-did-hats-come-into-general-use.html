  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“When did Hats come into general use? The first mention made of hats is about the time of the Saxons, but they were not worn except by the rich. Hats for men were invented at Paris, by a Swiss, in 1404. About the year 1510, they were first manufactured in London, by Spaniards. Before that time both men and women in England commonly wore close, knitted, woollen caps. It is related, that when Charles the Second made his public entry into Rouen, in 1449, he wore a hat lined with red velvet, surmounted with a plume or tuft of feathers; from which entry, or at least during his reign, the use of hats and caps is to be dated. Where is Rouen? In the province of Lower Seine, in France.” — Benziger Brothers, <em>A Catechism Of Familiar Things, Their History, And The Events Which Led To Their Discovery</em></p>
