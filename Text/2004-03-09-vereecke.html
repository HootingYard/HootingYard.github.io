  <h1>Vereecke!</h1>
  <p>Yesterday's quotation of the day, Wilma Salisbury's terrific description of a dance by Father Bob VerEecke, included a link to a page about the terpsichorean Jesuit. What was lacking, however, was a photograph of our hero in action. Here he is:</p>

  </div>
  <p>Not only that. Pansy Cradledew has unearthed a tremendous picture of Father Bob's workshop. She says: “Isn't it marvellous? Apart from his preposterous gestures, the startled way his students seem to be staring (or trying not to stare!) at him is priceless.” You'll find this treasure, next to a big caption saying “Dancing In The Spirit Of The Season”, at the <a class="external" href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v9/n30/n30.html">Boston College Chronicle</a>.</p>
