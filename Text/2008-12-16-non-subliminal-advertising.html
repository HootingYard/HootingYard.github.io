  <p>Apparently, if you use Lulu's super-duper extra fast express uberexpensive delivery option, it is Not Too Late to receive copies of Hooting Yard books in time for Christmas. (While we are on the subject, I would like to point out that I insist on calling Christmas Christmas rather than one of those wretched multi-or-no-faith euphemisms which are, as we know, abominations not to be tolerated.) So to avoid being faced with sulky disappointed relatives and friends on Christmas Day, go <a href="http://stores.lulu.com/store.php?fAcctID=778759" class="external"><strong>here</strong></a> and order your copies right this minute.</p>
