  <h1 id="post-16376">Hatgate!</h1>
  <p>The <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463496" class="external"><strong>row</strong></a> between Twittery Corbynistas and the BBC over Jeremy Corbyn's hat—a row some have dubbed <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-43463496" class="external"><strong>Hatgate</strong></a> – reminded me that during the late 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, my father sported a Russian-style winter hat. This led some neighbours on our council estate to surmise that my Pa was a Soviet spy. The fact that he regularly popped in to the newsagent's to pick up a copy of the <em>Morning Star</em> probably added to their suspicions. Unfortunately I don't have a photograph, doctored or otherwise, of my father in his Communist headgear.</p>

  <p>One of the amusing things about all the nitwit fans losing their marbles over supposed BBC perfidy is that there must be thousands of photographs of Corbyn wearing self-styled “revolutionary” attire. Remember that the dear leader's politics are still those of an earnest teenager circa 1968. Before becoming Labour leader, he was regularly pictured wearing Leninist workers' caps or one of those scarves the Palestinian death cult maniacs are so fond of.</p>
  <p>OK, now I'm off to the political re-education camp to learn the errors of my ways.</p>
