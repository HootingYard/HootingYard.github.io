  <h1>And No Birds Sing</h1>
  <p>Or do they? Here at Hooting Yard we have taken on a new member of staff to assist us in all matters ornithological. The interview process was exhausting, possibly because our recruitment advert, by some mishap, appeared in <em>Bee People</em> magazine instead of <em>Jobs For The Bird-Obsessed</em>, our publication of choice. That misunderstanding dealt with, we questioned what in the name of heaven had persuaded us to hold the selection process in the annexe of a House Of Sortilege &amp; Magick hard by the banks of a tempestuous river on the point of bursting its banks, fourteen miles from the nearest railway station. We eventually appointed Jim Pond, a man with a blue hat and dozens of library tickets, who suggested that his first contribution ought to be some birdsongs: the <a class="internal-audio" href="../Media/2004-07-lapwing_w.wav" title="The song of the lapwing">lapwing</a>, the <a class="internal-audio" href="../Media/2004-07-curlew_w.wav" title="The song of the curlew">curlew</a>, and quite alarmingly, the <a class="internal-audio" href="../Media/2004-07-c_crow_w.wav" title="The song of the carrion crow">carrion crow</a>. Jim has now gone off to join the Richard Milhous Nixon Memorial Sweatlodge, and it is unclear if he is ever coming back.</p>
