  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2014/01/little-dagobert-a-tale-from-frank-keys-forthcoming-ebook/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> today, the tale of Little Dagobert, The Strongest Boy In The Universe. This acts as a preview for the imminent Kindle anthology <em>By Aerostat To Hooting Yard&nbsp;: A Frank Key Reader</em>, published next week by Dabbler Editions. I shall have more to say about this definitive collection next Tuesday, when it will become available. In the meantime, please bear in mind that you lot will be harried and hectored relentlessly until you have (a) bought a copy, and (b) harried and hectored, in your turn, every single person you know to buy a copy, and (c) propelled it, if not to the very top of the e-bestseller lists, at least to the point where I am in with a chance of winning the mrs joyful prize for rafia work.</p>
