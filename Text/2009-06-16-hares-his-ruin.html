  <h1>Hares His Ruin</h1>
  <p>Should you find yourself consulting your <strong><a href="2009-06-15-crows-and-hares.html" class="internal" title="Crows And Hares">hare oracle</a></strong> with unseemly frequency, or favouring it to such an extent that your crow oracle sits neglected on the shelf, you may be on the slippery slope to a hare mania leading to criminality. Here is a newspaper cutting from 1904. Consider it a warning.</p>
  <p><em>HARES HIS RUIN</em></p>
  <p><em>In sentencing a man at Marylebone yesterday for stealing a hare, Mr Plowden said to the prisoner, who had previously been bound over for a similar offence: “You are an honest man, I believe, except when you see hares. Then, your honesty completely breaks down. It's a good thing you don't live where hares are abundant.”</em></p>
