  <h1>The Ship of Fools</h1>
  <p>From balloons to ships. There is much in the Key archives (see below) that was <em>not</em> on the old Hooting Yard site, but that seems worth an airing here—like this drawing of <a class="internal-image" href="../Images/2003-12-shipoffools.jpg">the ship of fools</a> which first appeared on the cover of Re Records Quarterly Magazine Vol. 2 No. 4 as long ago as 1989.</p>
