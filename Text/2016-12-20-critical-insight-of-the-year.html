  <p>There are startling similarities to be found in the film characters John McClane in <em>Die Hard</em> and Ellen Ripley in <em>Alien</em>. In particular,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>both have formative traumatic experiences in air ducts: arguably, both heroines are born within the air ducts.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Just one of many nuggets of wisdom scattered throughout “Making fists with your toes: Towards a feminist analysis of <em>Die Hard</em>”, an essay by Zoe Stavri, aka <strong><a href="https://stavvers.wordpress.com/2016/12/18/making-fists-with-your-toes-towards-a-feminist-analysis-of-die-hard/" class="external">Another Angry Woman</a></strong>. Make sure you read it before watching that magnificent film for the umpteenth time.</p>
  <p>Thanks to Roberta Mock for drawing this to my attention.</p>
