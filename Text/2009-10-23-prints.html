  <h1>Prints</h1>
  <p>Proof at last that Hooting Yard's eco-credentials are second to none! It is two and a half years since we raised the important issue of carbon hoofprints, with reference, I recall, to a <strong><a href="2007-03-09-vagrant-goat-god.html" class="internal" title="Vagrant Goat God">vagrant goat god</a></strong>. Well, we were scorned and ridiculed, but now, eventually, as I suspected would happen, the world has caught up with our visionary eco-consciousness.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="http://mreugenides.blogspot.com/2009/10/save-planet-eat-pet.html" class="external">Mr Eugenides</a></strong> provides the valuable service of directing our attention to a recent study:</p>
  <p><em>The eco-pawprint of a pet dog is twice that of a 4.6-litre Land Cruiser driven 10,000 kilometres a year, researchers have found.</em></p>
  <p>(Incidentally, I think it was our Antipodean correspondent Glyn Webster who created a superb compendium of wisdom by tapping “researchers have found” into Google. Perhaps he can post it in the Comments.)</p>
  <p>Of course, our tireless endeavours to be the most eco-superduper website in the universe continue apace. Even as I write, earnest beardy besandalled Cassandras are hard at work in the Hooting Yard Eco-Pod tallying up stats on the carbon talonprints of a crow, the flipperprints of sea lions, and—thrillingly—the eco-suckerprints of various squelchy aquatic life-forms.</p>
