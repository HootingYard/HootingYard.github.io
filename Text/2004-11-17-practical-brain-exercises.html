  <h1>Practical Brain Exercises</h1>
  <p>The Blodgett Global Domination Institute has issued a new pamphlet containing a series of practical brain exercises, to encourage—it says here—“enhanced thinking patterns for all and sundry”. The pamphlet has been given the somewhat twee title <em>Put On Your Thinking Cap!</em>, although I doubt that will improve sales. Anyway, here are two exclusive tips for Hooting Yard readers to try out:</p>
  <p>1. Place an envelope on a flat surface, such as a table or desktop. If you are short of furniture, the floor will do. Now, very carefully, with your fingertips, push the envelope gently across the surface.</p>
  <p>2. Obtain a large box. If it has a lid, remove it. Stand in the box or, if it is big enough, sit or squat. After a few minutes, clamber out of the box and start to think about something.</p>
