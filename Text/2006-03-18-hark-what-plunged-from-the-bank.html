  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Hark! what plunged from the bank—what black thing moves towards him across the water? The crocodile! coming with tears in his eyes, and a long grin of serried teeth. Coming!—the ugly scaly head is always nearer and nearer. The boy screams; but who should hear him? He feels whether the talisman be yet round his neck. He screams again, calling, in half-delirium, upon his dead mother. Meanwhile the scaly snout is close upon him.” — Julian Hawthorne, <em>Idolatry</em></p>
