  <h1>Zoltan &amp; Istvan</h1>
  <p>“Crikey!” exclaimed Istvan. He had just noticed that a fierce gigantic elephant-like being was thundering towards him, &amp; that he was almost certain to be crushed to death within the next few seconds.</p>
  <p>“Have you ever read <em>The Anatomy of Melancholy</em>?” asked his twin brother Zoltan, who was reclining in a hammock safely out of the path of the fierce gigantic elephant-like being. Zoltan was speaking through a shiny red loudhailer.</p>
  <p>“Cease taunting me with seventeenth century prose!” cried Istvan, “Is it beyond your puny wits to see that I am about to be flattened by a fierce gigantic elephant-like being?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, I wouldn't worry about that,” drawled Zoltan, “It will be stopped in its tracks by the mahout who is at this very moment careering across the verdant greensward bent on intercepting it.”</p>
  <p>“Pah!” expostulated Istvan, his terror momentarily submerged beneath contempt for his brother, “Next you will be telling me that you are ignorant of the two salient features of all mahouts: one, they are unhinged, and two, their skills are defunct in this our brave new century.”</p>
  <p>The fierce gigantic elephant-like being had meanwhile halved the distance between itself &amp; Istvan, whose now renewed terror rooted him to the spot. That spot, incidentally, lay a yard or two from a chance splash of campions in bloom, their vivid colours a pleasing contrast to the bracken, furze &amp; bindweed run riot o'er the greensward as far as the human eye could see. Zoltan removed his pince-nez, &amp; holding them with strange delicacy in his mighty, hairy fist, he said: “That's as may be, o twin, but I can assure you that this particular mahout is both hinged &amp; funct.”</p>
  <p>And he was proved correct, for just then the said mahout leapt astride the fierce gigantic elephant-like being &amp; coaxed it to a halt.</p>
