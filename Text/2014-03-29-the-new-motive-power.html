  <blockquote>
    <p>The New Motive Power was constructed of copper, zinc and magnets, all carefully machined, as well as a dining room table. At the end of nine months, Spear and an unnamed woman, also referred to as “Mary of the New Dispensation” ritualistically birthed the contraption in an attempt to give it life. Unfortunately for Spear, this failed to have the desired effect, and the machine was later dismantled.</p>

  <p>The sort of paragraph that compels me to do further research. From <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2014/03/john-murray-spear-the-electric-messiah/" class="external">John Murray Spear &amp; The Electric Messiah</a></strong></em> in today's <em>Dabbler</em>.</p>
