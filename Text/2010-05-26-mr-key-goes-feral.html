  <h1 id="post-4527">Mr Key Goes Feral</h1>
  <p>Babbling prose into a microphone for half an hour every week is all very well, but occasionally one feels impelled to vent in a less… shall we say, <em>prosaic</em> manner. To this end, I am very pleased (I think) to be taking part in a performance by <strong><a href="http://www.philmintonsferalchoir.com/about.htm" class="external">Phil Minton's Feral Choir</a></strong> this coming Saturday, 29th May.</p>
  <p>Tune in to <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/" class="external">ResonanceFM</a></strong> at 8.00 PM, and—as Charles Ives recommended—“sit down, pin back your ears, and listen like a man!” (Women are equally adept at this practice.)</p>
  <p>Incidentally, and quite coincidentally, both Phil Minton and I have contributions due to appear in a forthcoming recipe book, to be sold for charity. I am not joking. I will of course keep readers fully informed, so you can buy innumerable copies when this invaluable tome hits the boulevards.</p>
