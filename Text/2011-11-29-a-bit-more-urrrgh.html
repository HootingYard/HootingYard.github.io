  <h1 id="post-7731">A Bit More … Urrrgh</h1>
  <p>The <em>Grauniad</em> asks some of those who worked with him to share their <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/nov/28/ken-russell-tributes" class="external">memories</a></strong> of the late Ken Russell. Among them, Glenda Jackson, who recalls:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a director he never said anything very specific. He'd say, “It needs to be a bit more … <em>urrrgh</em>, or a bit less <em>hmmm</em>“, and you knew exactly what he meant.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>That's so true, isn't it? Paying due attention to the ellipsis, Hooting Yard has been on a constant mission to be a bit more … <em>urrrgh</em>, and a bit less <em>hmmm</em>, and we shall redouble our efforts in memory of the great man, until it's entirely … <em>urrrgh</em> and there is not &nbsp;a trace of <em>hmmm</em> whatsoever.</p>
