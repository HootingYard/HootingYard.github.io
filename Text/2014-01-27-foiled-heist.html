  <h1 id="post-12336">Foiled Heist!</h1>
  <p>Earlier today I had an errand to do which involved taking a rather large sum of cash to the bank. (My idea of what constitutes a “large sum” may not be yours.) Pansy Cradledew fretted that I might be waylaid by malefactors and ne'er-do-wells, so when I got back—safe and sound—I sent her a reassuring message. I swear on my mother's life* that every word of this is true.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Just a note to let you know that as I was leaving the bank, several chaps in stocking masks burst in waving firearms and shouting at everyone to get on the floor. I executed a quick <em>tableau vivant</em> of a scene from <em>Die Hard</em> (John McTiernan, 1988), and the villains were so awestruck by the verisimilitude of my pose that they were stunned, staring goggle-eyed and dropping their guns. After that it was a simple enough matter to summon Detective Captain Cargpan and his rufty tufty henchmen, who placed them under arrest while I sashayed off to catch the bus.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>*NOTA BENE&nbsp;:</strong> Ms Cradledew has asked me to point out that my mother died twenty years ago, a fact which she says utterly invalidates my swearage. That may well be so, but I know my onions.</p>
