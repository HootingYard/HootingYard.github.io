  <p>(To the tune of <em>Oh Bring Me Your Winding-Sheet, Mother Of Mine</em>)</p>
  <p>My name is P.V.Glob<br />
  I wrote a book about a bog<br />
  “Bog” spelled backwards is “Gob”<br />
  And that is the name of my dog</p>
  <p>In Russian, “God” is “Bog”<br />
  And my dog Gob's a dog-god<br />
  He sleeps all day like a log<br />
  For a dog he's a lazy sod</p>
  <p>I walk Gob to the bog<br />
  To wake him from his snooze<br />
  I can't see the bog for the fog<br />
  But I hear the cows' plaintive moos</p>
  <p>There are, you see, cows near the bog<br />
  And one of them is a cow-god<br />
  A god like Gog and Magog<br />
  Gods who are really quite odd</p>
  <p>So slumped in the muck by the bog<br />
  Invisible because of the fog<br />
  There's me, the writer P.V.Glob<br />
  And my little pet doggie, Gob</p>
  <p>He is by no means a fearsome hound<br />
  Wait! What's that uncanny sound?<br />
  It's the sound of the cow-god's bog-side mooing<br />
  The sound of my and Gob's undoing.</p>
