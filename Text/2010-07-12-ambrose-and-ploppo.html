  <p>Dramatis Personae</p>
  <p>SIGNOR PLOPPO, a man of parts</p>
  <p>AMBROSE, a bird</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: Bring me a jar of lemon curd!</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: <em>(Aside)</em> Can such things be? A talking bird? <em>(To Ambrose)</em> Whyfore dost thou want lemon curd?</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: Perchance this day my loins to gird.</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: I did not know that birds have loins. However, if you give me some coins, I will go and buy a jar. There is a curd shop not so far.</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: I beg thee, signor, use your own cash. <em>(Aside)</em> Should I praise his fine moustache? <em>(To Ploppo)</em> Your moustache is really great. Now hurry before it is too late!</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: Fear not, the curd shop never shuts. But –</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: But me no buts! Go and buy my lemon curd, or I shall be a distraught bird.</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: <em>(Aside)</em> I loathe the prospect of a bird distraught. It goes against everything I was taught. My parents put it very well—“Be good to birds, or you'll go to hell.”</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: <em>(Aside)</em> If I had hands, I'd clap with glee. This signor fears upsetting me. His childhood guilt, it haunts him yet. <em>(To Ploppo)</em> Make sure the lemon curd's thick-set. I cannot bear it thin and runny.</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: Are you quite sure you have no money?</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: As sure as eggs is eggs, signor. Now do not tarry anymore. Go to the shop and buy me curd, or I shall be a loin-limp bird.</p>
  <p>PLOPPO&nbsp;: I will do as you ask and pay for your snack.</p>
  <p>Exit PLOPPO</p>
  <p>AMBROSE&nbsp;: The next scene is called “When Birds Attack!”</p>
