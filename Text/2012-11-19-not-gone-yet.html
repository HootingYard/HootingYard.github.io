  <h1>Not Gone Yet</h1>
  <p>Mr Key has not yet fled the country—I will be leaving at some ungodly hour tomorrow—so my <strong><a href="2012-11-16-on-ganging-agley.html" class="internal" title="On Ganging Agley">hiatus announcement</a></strong> was a little premature. I thought I would feel bereft at neglecting important Hooting Yard business for a few days, but in fact I feel immensely relieved. A few days ago I mentioned the <strong><a href="2012-11-15-on-parsnips-and-kalashnikovs-and-cows.html" class="internal" title="On Parsnips And Kalashnikovs And Cows">Quaker</a></strong> I knew who was cheered by having a complete absence of activity in his brainpans, and I now understand what he meant. But fear not, I will return to the fray upon my return to Blighty.</p>
  <p>In the meantime, here is a letter that plopped into my inbox yesterday.</p>
  <blockquote>
