  <p>Unfortunately, Madame Boubou did not enclose a snapshot of her engulfment by ectoplasm with her <a href="2007-05-22-a-message-from-beyond.html" class="internal" title="A Message From Beyond"><em><strong>Message From Beyond</strong></em></a>. As luck would have it, a trawl through the Hooting Yard Archives turned up this picture which enables lucky readers to see with their own eyes the amazing phenomenon of ectoplasmic hoo-ha:</p>

  <p>According to <a href="http://uk.geocities.com/tmjones28/harrison.htm" class="external"><strong>The Minnie Harrison Page</strong></a>, what we see here is “ectoplasm emanating from the Medium's mouth. Taken in complete darkness using Kodak infra-red plate. Exposure by means of powerful ‘Sashalight’ bulb through ‘Wratten’ glass filter—extremely deep ruby-red colour. The Ectoplasm is emanating from her mouth and in this form it is quite transparent, very similar in appearance and texture to chiffon.”</p>
  <p>Those of you who think Minnie Harrison is sitting there in her 1948 Middlesbrough sitting room with a net curtain stuffed in her mouth are sadly deluded and will not get a helping of Madame Boubou's delicious Boiled Rhubarb Surprise.</p>
