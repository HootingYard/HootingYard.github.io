  <p>Yesterday I told you lot it is <strong><a href="2017-03-13-brain-awareness-week.html" class="internal" title="Brain Awareness Week">International Brain Awareness Week</a></strong>. I neglected to mention that it is also International Brian Awareness Week. This is the time of year when we make sure we are aware that the full name of Cornelius Cardew, the firebrand Marxist-Leninist composer and author of <em>Stockhausen Serves Imperialism</em>, who once threw Yoko Ono out of his house, was Brian Cornelius Cardew. Why did he drop the Brian? It seems a far more “proletarian” name than Cornelius, so one would have thought he would embrace it. As Wilcox—a non-Brian—noted, “it'th a mythtery”.</p>
