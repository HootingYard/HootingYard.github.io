  <p>The writing was on the wall for Minnie Menetekelupharsin.</p>
  <p>This is the opening line of a piece called <em>Belshazzar's Feast</em>. So far it is the only line I have written, as I am not sure it has anywhere to go. I am posting it here in case anybody wishes to use it as a gag at an Old Testament standup comedy night.</p>
