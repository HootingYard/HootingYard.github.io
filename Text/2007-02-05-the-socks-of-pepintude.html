  <h1 id="post-22">The Socks Of Pepintude</h1>
  <p>Today I am wearing the Socks of Pepintude, and so attired I shall stride forth decisively. There is of course a risk that curs will snuffle at my socks, and kittens too, possibly, for the Socks of Pepintude emit odours which convulsively befuddle our four-footed friends, though they remain undetectable by the human nose. Or so I have been told by my spy at the lab, who keeps me up to date on such matters. It is best to wear a pair of tough Uruguayan Air Force boots over the Socks of Pepintude. This will go some way to deter curs, and kittens, and thus one's decisive progress through the boulevards meets with less travail.</p>
  <p>You may ask where I am going, so decisively, through the boulevards of this important town. I am going to the post office. Alas, unlike the post office in Plovdiv it is not emblazoned with a mural painted by the <a href="http://www.plovdivguide.com/figures/fig.php?id=448&amp;lang_id=1&amp;alpha=G" class="external">Plovdiv Fivesome</a>, but none the less it is a very fine post office. Outside it on the esplanade is a flagpole with a big blue flag flying atop it. The doors are made of some weird iridescent metal and <em>swoosh</em> open as one approaches. Having thrown off any trailing curs and kittens I am going to cause those doors to <em>swoosh</em> and I shall make my decisive strides into the post office lobby, where a cadet in a cadet's cap and tunic will point me towards a queue leading to a counter behind which I know in the innermost fibres of my being there will be a tally-stick person ready to sell me some postage-related items.</p>
  <p>When the exchange has been made, I will exit again through the <em>swooshing</em> doors, having saluted the cadet, and I shall stride decisively into the esplanade, and gaze at the flag atop the flagpole, and I shall not flinch.</p>
