  <h1>Spinoza's Rhubarb</h1>
  <p>I mentioned this book in yesterday's Rant. Now it transpires that it actually exists:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dear Hooting Yard&nbsp;: I have been searching the internet for references to <em>Spinoza's Rhubarb</em> in vain for some years. As the owner of the only known copy of this work (Printed in Venice in 1668) I have become what my family call ‘pathologically obsessed’ with promulgating the philosophy of Spinoza's greatest but least known work. In my eagerness to spread the word I have created a number of ‘stump work’ pictures showing the life of Spinoza and have been touring the exhibition around the churches and chapels of my native country for some years. I wonder if you would have space on your website for a picture of one of my latest works. I would be so grateful if this were possible. Yours in hope and with God's Blessing, Stanley J. Cachinnatione, Montana, USA</p>
