  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The music sang, and the spires twinkled, and Eric said, ‘I am Eric North!’ The sword point jerked and the sentinel straightened. His face was white. He cried aloud, ‘It is Eric the Bronze. It is Eric of the Legend’. He whirled the sword aloft, and smashed it upon Eric's metal hat, and the hatred was a blue flame in his eyes… The helmet contained an electrical circuit, designed as a shield against electrical waves tuned to affect his brain. But the hat had failed…” — V E Thiessen, <em>The Beast-Jewel Of Mars</em></p>
