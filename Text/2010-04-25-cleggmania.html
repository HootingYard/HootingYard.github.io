  <p>I know I promised not to babble on about the general election, but hope I will be forgiven for sharing with you this important note. Thanks to Gaw over at <strong><a href="http://gawragbag.blogspot.com/2010/04/clegg-and-shag-hag-dreg-prig.html" class="external">Ragbag</a></strong>, I learned that ‘Clegg’ is another word for a horse-fly. Here is the full OED definition, with handy quotations for use when a Liberal Democrat canvasser comes a-pounding at your door:</p>
  <p><strong>cleg</strong></p>
  <p>Also 5 <strong>clege</strong>, 6 <strong>clegge</strong>, 7–9 <strong>clegg</strong>.</p>
  <p>A gadfly, horse-fly, or breeze.</p>
