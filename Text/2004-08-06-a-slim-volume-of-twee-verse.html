  <h1>A Slim Volume of Twee Verse</h1>
  <p>It is quite a while since anything has been heard from the poet Gervase Beerpint, author of <em>Homage To Neurasthenia</em> and <em>Do You Know The Way To Sin, José?</em><span class="asterisk">*</span>, so it is with something akin to breathless overexcitement that his publishers announce a forthcoming volume, his first since the cataclysmic events of Bastardgate engulfed John Major's Conservative administration of 1990 to 1997.</p>

  <p>Provocatively entitled <em>A Slim Volume Of Twee Verse</em>, Beerpint's latest is a huge slab of a book. Truman Capote said of Kerouac's <em>On The Road</em> that “it's not writing, it's typing”, and one feels that were Mr C still with us, he would make the same waspish remark about the torrent of verbiage spewed across these pages. It is difficult to know what to make of a work that steadfastly refuses to engage the reader in any way. At times it reads like an ironmongery catalogue for upwards of a hundred pages, then without warning the poet launches into his own (incompetent) Tagalog translation of the <em>Book of Isaiah</em>. Some of the old standby Beerpint motifs are here—popinjays, choc ices, and dust—but as a whole the work is baffling, perhaps even rubbish.</p>
  <p>We rang the poet to ask some pertinent questions, but all that could be heard from his end of the line was <a class="internal-audio" href="../Media/2004-08-sonar.wav" title="The pinging of sonar">this</a>.</p>
