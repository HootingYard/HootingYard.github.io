  <p>Here is a photograph of Mr Key's mud idol. As is <em>de rigueur</em> with mud idols, nails have been driven into it. In this case, each nail represents the immortal soul of a badger, or of an otter. During secret ceremonies, Mr Key prostrates himself on his stomach before the mud idol and, in guttural ululations, beseeches it to pulverise his foes using the maleficent <em>Gaar</em>, or energy, of the badgers and otters impacted within its mudness.</p>
