You can read about him <strong><a href="http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/liturgicalyear/calendar/day.cfm?date=2009-09-18" class="external">here</a></strong>, to which I would add these observations from <em>Some Human Oddities&nbsp;: Studies In The Queer, The Uncanny And The Fanatical</em> by Eric John Dingwall (1947):</p>

At first he was destined to work in the refectory, but the result of his frequent fits of absence of mind and ecstatic states on the crockery was disastrous, and Joseph added to the irritation caused by his breakages by wearing the pieces round his neck…&nbsp; the accounts of his childhood, lack of education and later mental development suggest that he was not far from what today we should call a state of feeble-mindedness. Bishop Bonaventura Claver said that he was <em>idiota</em>.”</p>
