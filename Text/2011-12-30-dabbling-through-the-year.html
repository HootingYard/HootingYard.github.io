  <p>In the dying days of the twelvemonth, you can barely open a newspaper or magazine, watch the television or listen to the radio without being confronted by yet another “Review Of The Year” or “Round-Up Of The Key Events Of 2011”. Blather blather blather. The thing about these space-fillers is that they tend to be cobbled together on the hoof, with little thought, and—understandably, I suppose—lack any proper historical perspective. What seems important to hacks as the year takes its last gasps may, in fifty or a hundred years' time, be quite forgotten, and 2011 may be remembered for other events entirely, ones which, to us who lived through them, seem trivial and unworthy of remark.</p>
  <p>So when I was commissioned by the editors of <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> to write my own review of 2011, I put on my futurologist's cap (satin and wool, tassles, earflaps) and, with the aid of Dr Baxter's Invigorating Brain Syrup, I looked at the year through the eyes of a Man Of The Future. What would a penniless out of print scribbler of 2111 pick out as the crucial events of 2011? My report is <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/12/2011-frank-keys-round-up-of-the-year/" class="external">here</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, having got quite a taste for the wearing of the cap and the glugging of the syrup, I am heading further into the future. I have set the controls for 2525, the year of Zager &amp; Evans' imperishable chart-topper, and will let you know how I get on.</p>
