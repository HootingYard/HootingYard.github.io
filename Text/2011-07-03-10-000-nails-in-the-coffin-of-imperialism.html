  <p>Here is the score of Cornelius Cardew's 1971 piece <em>10,000 Nails In The Coffin Of Imperialism</em>. (Click on the image for a slightly larger view.) Note particularly that “yeah!” at the end.</p>

  <p>Cardew submitted the piece for publication in the magazine <em>Aspen</em>, but it was rejected by the editor, American composer Tom Johnson, for being “just too out of keeping with the issue as a whole”. How different the world might be, forty years later, if the piece had been published! All over the world, proletarians would have pored over the latest issue of <em>Aspen</em> in their millions, seized on the revolutionary implications of Cardew's score, and begun the inevitable historical process of driving those ten thousand nails into the coffin of imperialism, thus ushering in a bright new Maoist Utopia of political re-education camps and mass famine, where “workers would machine-gun bosses into bloody pits”, in the words of a poem in praise of Cardew's political mentor Hardial Bains. Er… yeah!</p>
