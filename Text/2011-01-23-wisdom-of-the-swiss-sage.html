  <p>Swiss sage Alain De Botton excels himself:</p>
  <p>“Airlines and travel agencies should think more about the nature of their business. At one level they're sending passengers around the world. At a deeper level they're connecting people with their dreams and hopes. I would like to be offered a therapy service prior to booking a ticket, and have a chance to talk to a therapeutically trained agent about why I want to travel to a particular place.”</p>
  <p>From an interview in Lufthansa in-flight magazine, quoted in Pseuds' Corner, <em>Private Eye</em> No. 1280, 21 January—3 February 2011</p>
