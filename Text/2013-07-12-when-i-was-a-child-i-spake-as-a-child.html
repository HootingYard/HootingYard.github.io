  <p>A. N. Wilson begins a book review in <em>The Spectator</em> with this splendid anecdote:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ronald Knox, found awake aged four by a nanny, was asked what he was thinking about, and he replied “the past”.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>A remark with a similar weight of world-weariness was made by my eldest son, when he was but a tot. Having contracted some sort of stomach bug, he vomited. As we mopped his fevered brow, he wailed “Oh, why can't I have a happy life?”</p>
