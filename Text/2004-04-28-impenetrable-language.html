  <h1>Impenetrable Language</h1>
  <p>There may be readers who understand the above quotation. I like it for the simple reason that no matter how closely I read it, I know that it would take years of study before I could ever eke any meaning from it. There is a fascination in impenetrable texts which is quite different from looking at a passage written in a foreign language of which one is ignorant: that has its own pleasures, of course. Most of the words above are familiar to me; the ones that aren't I can look up in a dictionary; and still I will be unable to wring any sense out of it. I used to be a regular reader of the Bridge column in one of the Sunday newspapers. I have never played Bridge, nor had any desire to do so, but I loved these short texts describing situations, tactics and possibilities of a game whose rules I knew not. The words took on an abstract quality for me. That's all.</p>
