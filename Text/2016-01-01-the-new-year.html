  <p>It has become the tradition here at Hooting Yard to herald the new year with a 2010 quotation from Peter Hitchens. This year, his magnificent words appear over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2015/12/seeing-in-the-new-year-with-peter-hitchens/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, which has kindly added a puff for my book <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em>. Alas, this important work of reference did not, as I hoped, become a hugely successful pre-Christmas bestseller, so I shall probably be reduced to buttonholing strangers in the streets and imploring them to buy a copy, as I weep and dribble.</p>
