  <p>“Tanquod Shuddery's bloated frame hove into view from behind the barn.”</p>
  <p>This is the opening line of Dennis Beerpint's latest piece of poetical whimsy. Indeed, it is the <em>only</em> line, for the twee versifier has had a fit of the vapours and put down his pencil. He is pallid, and shaking, and staring wild-eyed into the grate where a few sticks are burning weakly. He wonders if his talent has been dissipated by his newfound devotion to buzzing around in a light aircraft, swooping low over clumps of cows in fields and calling to them in a language they do not understand. Will Dennis get a grip? Can he salvage his poetic gift? Or will he dash out his brains on a paving slab? Don't miss the exciting new 26-part television drama series <em>Twee Poet In A Light Aircraft Swooping Upon Cows</em>.</p>
