  <h1>Food Scare</h1>
  <p>According to Alexandre Dumas in his <em>Grand Dictionnaire de Cuisine</em>, “the young wild duck shot at the end of August is called an albran. Albrans, which are to an ordinary duck as a partridge is to a hen, are broiled on the spit and served on toast soaked in their own juices, to which are added the juice of bitter oranges, a little soy sauce, and some grains of fine pepper”. That being the case, what exactly is contained in those packets of <em>All-Bran</em> sold by the Kellogg people? I think we should be told.</p>
