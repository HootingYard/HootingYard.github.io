  <p>Today the <em>Guardian</em> yet again employs the preposterous Russell Brand as a commentator. This time his overwritten wittering is about the death of Philip Seymour Hoffman, which gives the “alleged comedian” (©&nbsp;Peter Hitchens) another opportunity to tell us that he is a recovering addict. Well, who knew? He may indeed be recovering from drink and drugs, but I think it's time he sought help for his pitiable addiction to babbling on and on about himself. Several decades in a Trappist monastery would be ideal.</p>
  <p>Which brings us to the more important topic of Mr Key, or rather to his cupboard in <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2014/02/but-what-would-dick-emery-do-the-role-of-the-comedian-in-british-political-life/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong></em>, which today contains a piece about the role played by comedians in the governance of Britain. <strong>Warning:</strong> I am afraid Brand is mentioned there again—I really must get a grip!—though only in passing, and you lot will be able to sluice him out of your brains by contemplating, instead, such stars of yesteryear as Wilson, Keppel, and Betty.</p>
