    <p class="caption">While you wait for me to aim my alphabetic skewer at the letter U, hike over to <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2010/10/keys-cupboard-a-president-and-his-potatoes/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> where, it being Friday, the doors of my cupboard are thrown open. The doors of my cupboard, incidentally, are not unlike Aldous Huxley's <em>Doors Of Perception</em>, in some ways. In other ways, they are utterly different. I shall leave it to you to allocate the similarities and differences, it will give you something to do at lunchtime. Anyway, this week I confess my foolish fascination with a president and his potatoes.</p>
