  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Do I know what my colours are? Do I make my vowels sing? Am I direct, sincere and simple? Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair? Am I lovable? Am I original? Am I valiant? Have I made a legal will? Do I know where it is? Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off? Do I sew a snap-fastener on to each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a half long, and sew these tapes in the centre of all shoulder seams? Am I so poised, so on my centre, so innately joyous that life cannot sway me this way or that?” — Hill Edwards, <em>Personality Pointers</em></p>
