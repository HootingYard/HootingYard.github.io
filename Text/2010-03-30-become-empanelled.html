  <h1 id="post-4136">Become Empanelled!</h1>
  <p>I am extremely pleased to note the formation of a Google Group entitled <strong><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/the-soup-committee/" class="external">The Soup Committee</a></strong>, devoted to all things Hooting Yard. Though I have been empanelled as a sort of honorary member, the Committee is the brainchild of a number of very very sensible readers and listeners, its mission to promote Hooting Yard throughout interwebshire and the wider world until inevitable global domination is achieved. It is also a gathering place for enthusiasts to wallow in an online Hooting Yard wallowing facility.</p>
  <p>If you wish to be empanelled as a Soup Committee Person (and who would not?) please visit by clicking the link above, and make your application. Please note that to avoid an onslaught of annoying pill-peddling spam gits, it is <em>imperative</em> that you write something compelling when asked to provide your reason for wishing to be empanelled.</p>
