  <h1>Docking Hack</h1>
  <p>Hats are off in Docking; caps are being doffed. The council's got a town plan. The maths are on a chart. Pips have been spat out and drudgery is bye-byed. Chocolate puddings seem to be in everybody's pantry. And here comes Traitor Bill. He caught a shark in waters. His sou'wester's been askew since 1954-ish. Bubbles surge from froth. The chemist's shop is shut. There's pills &amp; pills &amp; pills that no Docking man could swallow. Suffering aborted. The council in a caucus. The shaven heads of heads of state are battering the doors down. The city gates, the turrets, the alleys, roads &amp; mews: Docking has its ears all go for red alert decisions. Language has been no-no'd, the bamboo men are wailing, the breakage rate is scheduled: the system has been broken. Crayons pink &amp; stacked, the burnt sienna packaged. Vandals clash at nightfall, but Docking has its crackers. Plastic wrapped in plastic. The Docking coffers emptied. Idiot brawl saloon bar, a gorgeous snag-tooth babble. Prepared to dance a hoocha, not a tear or boo-hoo. Thousands of museums stacked with golden maps. Misshapen trunk road closures. Big stone reconstructions. Docking's cottoned on: it's a town about a tower. The frame is out of kilter, the coughing's filling coffins. Oh, but I want to go back to that Docking, Docking hack.</p>
