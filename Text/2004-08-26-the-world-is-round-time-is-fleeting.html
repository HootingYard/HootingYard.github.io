  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The world is round. Time is fleeting. Is man an ox? No. Is he a patent inkstand? No. Was he created to occupy a house and fit his head to a hat? No. Then why delay? Why smother your longings? I says … this won't do. This ain't your destiny. Rise! Be winged! Chase the ideal! Get on the vastness! Seek and find.” — Arthur Colton, <em>The Belted Seas</em></p>
