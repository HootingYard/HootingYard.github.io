  <p>I am currently reading—or peering at, with my iffy eyes—<em>The Book Of Lost Books</em> by Stuart Kelly (2005). Among other things I have learned is that we have lost a work by the ancient polymath Callimachus (c.320—c.340 BCE) entitled <em>On The Changes Of The Names Of Fish</em>. I, for one, would love to read it, and I suspect it inspired a dream I had, where I came upon a copy of <em>On The Stiffness Or Otherwise Of Bolts Of Cloth</em> by Rotting Engineering Equipment Jr.</p>
