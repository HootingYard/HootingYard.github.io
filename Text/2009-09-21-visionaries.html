  <h1 id="post-3172">Visionaries</h1>
  <p>I was much taken with the title of a recent postage at the excellent <strong><a href="http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/" class="external">Ptak Science Books</a></strong> blog, to wit <strong><em><a href="http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2009/09/jf-ptak-science-books-llc-post-759-blog-bookstore----the-twenties-is-know-as-the-speed-decadeeverything-was--goin.html" class="external">Visionaries, Ice People, And The Marriage Of Stupid And Brutal</a></em></strong>. Indeed, fomenting within my pea-sized yet pulsating brain is a piece to which I can apply this title, a piece which will bear no actual relation to John Ptak's post, though that is well worth your attention. Now, on Channel Four News, I have just heard an arresting reference to “a visionary cobbler”.</p>
  <p>Clearly the ethereal spirits which reign within my brainpans are gently prodding me to turn my attention to visionaries. Watch this space.</p>
