  <h1 id="post-16854">The Future Of Women's Sport</h1>
  <p>In the current transgender hoo-hah, the implications for women's sport have prompted much controversy. If big burly blokes who “identify as” women, like “Dr” Rhys/Rachel McKinnon, are allowed to compete in women's events, what are the odds that, given their physical advantage, they will start winning everything? There are already enough instances of this happening to make women's prospects seem bleak.</p>
  <p>It so happens that the future of women's sport was televised almost half a century ago, on <em>Monty Python's Flying Circus</em>. In his fight against Petula Wilcox, boxer Ken Clean-Air System is not explicitly identified as trans, but of course those were far less enlightened times.</p>
