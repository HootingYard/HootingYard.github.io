  <p>How right I was to predict that the <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/kids-only/naturecams/beecam/index.html" class="external"><strong>Beecam</strong></a> would derail my harebrained scheme to make Hooting Yard a daily blog! Here is what happened yesterday:</p>
  <p>5.15 AM&nbsp;: Leap out of bed and plump myself in front of the beecam. Become enthralled.</p>
  <p>7.24 AM&nbsp;: Consider basic needs, such as washing and dressing and eating a hearty breakfast of kedgeree and bloaters and smokers' poptarts, but am so overwhelmed by the beecam that I postpone any activity.</p>
  <p>11.45 AM&nbsp;: Bee-haunted.</p>
  <p>3.00 PM&nbsp;: Numb to the human world. Beginning to think like a bee. Making occasional buzzing noises.</p>
  <p>3.14 PM&nbsp;: Nip away from the beecam momentarily to don yellow-and-black striped leotard and black hat with antennae.</p>
  <p>7.52 PM&nbsp;: Recall that I planned to write something daily for the Hooting Yard page. Am too transfixed by the beecam to move.</p>
  <p>11.35 PM&nbsp;: Realise that I have spent the entire day observing either bees or the absence of bees on the beecam. Suffused with a warm glow of bee-ness. Continue to watch bees with now bleary eyes. Make a mental note to explain to readers that “bleary-eyed” has nothing to do with terrifying diminutive MP Hazel Blears.</p>
  <p>1.07 AM&nbsp;: Drag myself reluctantly from beecam to bed. As I fall asleep, reflect upon the fact that I have never had so bee-centred a day as the day just gone. Resolve to be even more bee-minded in future.</p>
