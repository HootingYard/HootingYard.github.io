  <h1>Johnfowlesopoly</h1>
  <p>David Stoop has sent in a story from a game of <em>Johnfowlesopoly</em> (see “A Word Game”, 23rd March).</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Once upon a time, there was a debauched fairy named Bindweed. Bindweed, who liked to dress in fashionable, foreign-made fairy clothes, had a fairy sister called Ringrot. Ringrot was jaded and neurotic. On the day the big spaceship landed in Dandelion Dell, with its whirling propellors, Bindweed and Ringrot went skipping along to greet the goo-splattered alien beings.</p>
    <p>“Ugh!” screeched Bindweed, “Aren't they sickening?”</p>
    <p>Ringrot began to vomit, right next to the spaceship. The goo-splattered alien beings were extremely disturbed by this bestial behaviour. They climbed back into their spaceship and flew off to another planet, called Zixurg-K79. Goodnight children.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><em>Our critic writes:</em> David has made a pretty good fist of it, I think. All nine adjectives are included, the story is very short, and I would certainly read it to my grandchildren at bedtime.</p>
