  <h1>Stalking a Toad-headed Robber</h1>
  <p>The stalking of a robber with the head of a toad is one of twenty six items in a biographical index to the life of the criminal mastermind Walter Mad. The full index can be read in <a class="internal" href="2004-06-21-unspeakable-desolation-pouring-down-from-the-stars-contents.html">Chapter Five</a> of <em>Unspeakable Desolation Pouring Down From The Stars</em>, the latest episode in our thrilling weekly serial. It is curious that Dobson never turned his attention to Walter Mad, for he was fascinated by despicable malefactors of every stripe. He wrote percipiently about the so-called Irksome Poisoner of Cupflop, the Hungarian maniac Borag Lacko, and Blasphemous Ted Cargpan, among others, yet the indefatigable pamphleteer seems to have overlooked the madman once described as “the Steed Malbranque of Crime”, in reference to the evocatively-named football player. An annotated anthology of Dobson's writings on very, very bad people is currently in preparation.</p>
