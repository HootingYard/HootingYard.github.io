  <h1>Facecloth &amp; Witter</h1>
  <p>I would like to remind readers that Hooting Yard has an eerie, shimmering “presence” on both <strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/31550712740/" class="external">Facecloth</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://twitter.com/hootingyard" class="external">Witter</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>The Facecloth group is sunk in lassitude, but it can be revivified if you lot all join up and start posting the sorts of posts persons post on Facecloth, whatsoever they may be.</p>
  <p>The Witter site is automatically updated<strong>*</strong> every time Mr Key posts something here at Hooting Yard, which means I never have to lift a tweety finger, thank heavens. But I understand that following and retweeting things is a constant activity for half the planet these days, so I encourage you all to get cracking.</p>
  <p><strong>*</strong><strong>NOTA BENE</strong>&nbsp;: Due to inexplicable and quite possibly Lovecraftian forces at work in the aether, the updates have not been appearing for several months. This should be fixed soon, possibly by the time you read this.</p>
