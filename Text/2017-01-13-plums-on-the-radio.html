  <p>Fruit-lovers among you will be delighted to learn that I devoted the first <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> of the new year to plums. That is, all the pieces I read on the show made mention of plums, in several cases plums of the Carlsbad variety. This was received so well by listeners that I am seriously considering taking a plum-based approach to next week's show too. It is rare in the history of radio broadcasting, I think, for a single type of fruit to be granted such prominence in a programme not otherwise fruitcentric, or not ostensibly so. Should any fruiterers wish to give me a free bag of plums in recognition of my efforts, please do not hesitate to approach me in the boulevards and thrust a bag of plums at me.</p>
  <p>You can listen to the show <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-12th-january-2017/" class="external">here.</a></strong> If by chance you are allergic to plums, or simply abhor them, preferring, say, peaches or persimmons, you may wish instead to go and lie down in a darkened room with cotton wool stuffed into your lugholes. It is entirely up to you.</p>
