  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Can it be possibly believed, by the present eminently practical generation, that a busy people like the English, whose diversified occupations so continually expose them to the chances and changes of a proverbially fickle sky, had ever been ignorant of the blessings bestowed on them by that dearest and truest friend in need and in deed, the UMBRELLA?” — Robert Sangster, <em>Umbrellas &amp; Their History</em></p>
