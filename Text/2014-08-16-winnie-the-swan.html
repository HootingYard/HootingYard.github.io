  <h1>Winnie-The-Swan</h1>
  <p>Here at Hooting Yard we hate and despise A. A. Milne and all his works. Dorothy Parker had it right when, in her “Constant Reader” column in the <em>New Yorker</em>, she wrote,</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>And it is that word ‘hummy,’ my darlings, that marks the first place in <em>The House at Pooh Corner</em> at which Tonstant Weader fwowed up.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Nevertheless, I am delighted to learn that the “Pooh” part of the name Winnie-the-Pooh was originally attached to a swan, Pooh being the name Milne's son Christopher Robin gave to a swan he befriended in Angmering in Suffolk. If I did not have more important things to do with my time, I might go through the entire awful canon and rewrite the stories, making Winnie-the-Pooh a savage and violent swan instead of an allegedly cute bear. Volume I&nbsp;:&nbsp;<em>Winnie-the-Pooh Attacks <strong><a href="2013-07-19-henman-swanman.html" class="internal" title="Henman, Swanman">Tim Henman</a></strong> And Breaks His Arm.</em></p>
