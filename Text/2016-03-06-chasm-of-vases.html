  <h1 id="post-14635">Chasm Of Vases</h1>
  <p>The usual pronunciation of <em>vase</em>, in this country, is as a rhyme with <em>mars</em>. In the United States, it is more common for <em>vase</em> to rhyme with <em>lace</em>. Growing up on an Essex council estate with a Belgian mother whose native tongue was Flemish, however, I learned to rhyme <em>vase</em> with <em>jaws</em>.</p>
  <p>This was but one example of my mother's idiosyncratic English. She spoke of the old films we loved to watch as being “in white and black”, and regularly deployed a sort of guttural expostulation my sister still refers to as “the Flemish sound”. This was used to express a vast swathe of emotions, from surprise to incredulity to contempt to disgust to … well, pretty much any response.</p>
  <p>The word <em>chasm</em> is one that we probably encounter more in written than spoken English. My mother pronounced it with a soft <em>ch</em>, as in <em>chase</em> or <em>chicken</em>. So I did too, on the rare occasions I said it aloud. I only learned the correct, hard <em>c</em> pronunciation in my late teens, when I was reading a passage aloud in an English class at school and my teacher raised an amused eyebrow. He gently corrected me when I finished reading.</p>
  <p>Many years have passed, but I still find myself drawn inexorably to the pronunciations I learned at my mother's knee. And, intriguingly, my sister finds herself increasingly using “the Flemish sound” as she grows older.</p>
