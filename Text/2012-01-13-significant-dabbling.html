  <p>This week in <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2012/01/docking-hack/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I get misty-eyed and nostalgic about something or other. What I might be misty-eyed and nostalgic about is the fact that the piece was written over a quarter of a century ago, which is a somewhat unnerving thought. I did not know then what the piece was “about”, and in the succeeding twenty-five years I have come no closer to grasping the world-shuddering significance lurking within its two hundred and twenty-two words. But world-shuddering significance there is, of that we can be sure. Do let me know if you can work out what it is, because I still haven't got a clue.</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> I have changed two of those two hundred and twenty-two words for this twenty-first century version, but the meaning, whatever it might be, is not altered in any dramatic, or even undramatic, manner.</p>
