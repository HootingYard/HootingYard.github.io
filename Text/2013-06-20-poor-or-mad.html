  <h1>Poor Or Mad?</h1>
  <p>In an appendix to <em><strong><a href="2013-06-20-my-fulbourn-star.html" class="internal" title="My Fulbourn Star">On The Writing Of The Insane</a></strong></em>, G. Mackenzie Bacon notes the similarity between the writing of the insane and the writing of the lower orders.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the position I occupy I receive a good many letters from the poorer class, and have often had from some of my correspondents very odd specimens. The three following [which you can consult at the <strong><em><a href="http://publicdomainreview.org/2013/03/12/on-the-writing-of-the-insane-1870/" class="external">Public Domain Review</a></em></strong>] are from individuals belonging to what is called the <em>sane</em> portion of the public. In [one] the contrast between [the] style and those in the preceding pages [by certified lunatics] is perhaps not so well marked as one would like to expect.</p>
