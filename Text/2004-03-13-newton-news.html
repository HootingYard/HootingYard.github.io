  <h1>Newton News</h1>
  <p>We last drew attention to Sir Isaac Newton on 16th December last year. Here is a further anecdote. Passing swiftly over the fact that his name is an anagram of “ironic swans eat”, we ought also celebrate his powers of concentration. When his mind was fixed upon some knotty mathematical problem, as it so often was, he had great difficuly bestirring himself in the mornings. He was known to begin dressing, get one leg inside his breeches, then sit back down on the bed, lost in thought for hours upon hours. A proper caution, in other words.</p>
