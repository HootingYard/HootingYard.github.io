  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Anger, despair, ferocity, hunger, terror—all were depicted upon those awful faces. Through the cracked glass, deadly fumes began to steal, my room seemed cloudy, I was as if transfixed, unable to move, to call, to reach the lights, to do aught but stand staring, tremblingly. The faces pressed closer and yet closer; they reached the glass, it cracked again, and more fumes poured in; long arms (there seemed hundreds of them) reached wildly up, skinny hands, like those of skeletons, were held out as if to grasp.” — Bessie Kyffin-Taylor, <em>From Out Of The Silence</em></p>
