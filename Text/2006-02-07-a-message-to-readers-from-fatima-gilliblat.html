  <h1>A Message to Readers From Fatima Gilliblat</h1>
  <p>Hello! I want to encourage readers to wallow in the warm bath of asses' milk that is the new <a class="external" href="http://hootingyardannexe.blogspot.com/">Hooting Yard Annexe</a>. So while I was eating cake this morning, I had a bright idea. I wish to illustrate my bright idea with a picture of a lightbulb, but before I do that, I had better tell you what the bright idea is. Then I can eat some more cake. Actually, I've changed my mind. If you want to find out what my bright idea was, you will have to visit the <a class="external" href="http://hootingyardannexe.blogspot.com/">Annexe</a> entry for today's date. Here is the lightbulb:</p>
