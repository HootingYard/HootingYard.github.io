  <p>Charles Johnson:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>An austere character—he deemed jam “effeminate” and replaced his lost eye with a glass one from a stuffed albatross</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>His grandson, Anthony Brooke:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>[was] supercilious, reluctant to take advice and had displayed a tendency to judge officers according to their horoscopes… The unreliable Ranee later alleged that Anthony had been guilty of <em>folie de grandeur</em>, having cardboard crowns pinned to his car and ordering traffic to draw aside as he approached. Anthony denied this.</p>
  </blockquote>
