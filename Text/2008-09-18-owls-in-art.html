  <h1 id="post-569">Owls In Art</h1>
  <p>It has come to my attention that an art person called Alan Disparte has a “work on paper” entitled <em>Hooting Yard</em>, depicting transmogrified owls. Go and look at it <strong><a href="http://www.alandisparte.com/images/paper_hootingyard.jpg" class="external">here</a></strong>, and at his main page, or portal*, <strong><a href="http://www.alandisparte.com/" class="external">here</a></strong>. <em>Hommage</em> or coincidence? Who can say? I cannot help but notice that his name is an anagram of Natal Despair.</p>
  <p>* Do people still refer to “web portals”, or has that phrase gone the way of “the information superhighway” and other once thrilling coinages? This is not the kind of thing I know about, although I think this very page you are reading ought to be known as The Hooting Yard Portal, or Lobby, or Vestibule.</p>
