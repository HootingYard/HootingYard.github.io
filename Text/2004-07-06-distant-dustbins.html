  <h1>Distant Dustbins</h1>
  <p>I said to Smotter: “When that wagtail flew past my head, I did not know it was a wagtail. I thought it may have been a pipit, for I know very little about birds.” Spookily, at the very instant the words were out of my mouth, Smotter boarded a bus which took him far, far away, so crushing any hopes I had of improving my ornithological knowledge that morning. The number of the bus that Smotter caught had mystic significance, so I made a note of it on one of my bits of paper. My pockets are full of them. Every year, on Savonarola's birthday, I empty out from my coats and jackets all the accumulated scraps, stack them into a pile, randomly ordered, and type up my jottings verbatim. I have usually forgotten the context and import of most of my notes, so I have about as much idea as the readers of my annual <em>Pocketsbook</em> [sic] what it all means. In the early days, I separated each piece with an ellipsis, but at some point—possibly around the time of Lynnette “Squeaky” Fromme's assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford, I cannot be precise—I just ran one note headlong into another. Hence there are passages such as <em>the month of Frumentor possible pills for unknown disorders what is in the garden of the parsonage and why oo nooky (anag) printer's devil Gerard Manley Hopkins mesmerised a duck two sausage recipes</em> and so on. Thus do I wring sense from a baleful planet.</p>
