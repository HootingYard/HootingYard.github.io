  <h1>Foff</h1>
  <p>Following yesterday's note about three-letter place names, I feel I must enthuse about, and recommend, the latest addition to the groaning bookshelves at Haemoglobin Towers. I have only just started to read <strong><em><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/McKies-Gazetteer-Local-History-Britain/dp/184354654X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1223052861&amp;sr=1-1" class="external">McKie's Gazetteer&nbsp;: A Local History Of Britain</a></em></strong>, and am smitten (as I knew I would be). David McKie's book is not a comprehensive guide, but a series of essays about places that have caught his interest for one reason or another. The piece on Aberdeen, for example, is largely devoted to a potted biography of Alexander Cruden, the self-styled “Alexander The Corrector”, compiler of one of the most demented works of scholarship ever fashioned, the <strong><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cruden's_Concordance" class="external">Complete Concordance To The Holy Scriptures</a></em></strong>.</p>
  <p>I clapped my hands in glee to discover that <strong><a href="2008-09-13-the-roads-to-jaywick.html" class="internal" title="The Roads To Jaywick">Jaywick</a></strong> had not escaped McKie's attention. Though he does not mention <strong><a href="http://shewolf.notnet.co.uk/jaywick/events/cows/index.html" class="external">the day the cows came visiting</a></strong>, he is a fount of information on that ill-starred seaside resort, including the fact that it was founded by a man whose nickname was Foff.</p>
  <p>If you need any further persuading to buy this excellent book, bear in mind that David McKie used to write the Smallweed and McElsewhere columns in the <em>Guardian</em>, where, more than once, he made mention of Hooting Yard. Clearly a very sensible man.</p>
