    <p class="caption">It is fortunate that your own dear Mr Key is such a level-headed fellow, or I might begin to suffer from delusions of L Ron Hubbarddom. Notwithstanding the enduring popularity of the hideous bat god Fatso, it seems that the <strong><a href="2009-03-16-goat-god-catechism.html" class="internal" title="Goat God Catechism">Goat God Catechism</a></strong> has captured the imagination of the masses—or, if not quite the masses, then at least of two American podcasters.</p>
  </div>
  <p>First, the catechism was given a fine treatment by golden-voiced Norm Sherman at the <strong><a href="2010-12-05-radio-goat-god.html" class="internal" title="Radio Goat God">Drabblecast</a></strong>. Now it has been picked up by one Walter O'Hara. Mr O'Hara's podcast is called <strong><a href="http://misternizz.podbean.com/" class="external">Airy Persiflage</a></strong>, and with a title like that we can assume he is a man of impeccable taste. Indeed, he has also essayed a reading of some twaddle I wrote about <strong><a href="http://misternizz.podbean.com/2011/01/07/how-to-de-fang-your-venomous-serpent-by-frank-key/" class="external">venomous serpents</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>The striking thing about this <strong><a href="http://misternizz.podbean.com/2011/01/02/the-goat-god-catechism/" class="external">new version</a></strong> of the Goat God Catechism is Mr O'Hara's inspired decision to have a child read the responses. The child in question is “young Gar”, who lends a splendid piquancy to the piece. I wonder if young Gar hails from the awful, spooky land of Gaar, that place of nightmares and ill-advised picnics?</p>
