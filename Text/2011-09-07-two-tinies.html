  <p><em>Dear Mr Key,</em> writes Tim Thurn, <em>Always keen to keep abreast of the latest happenstances in popular culture, last evening I sat me down with a mug of cocoa and a bag of filberts to watch the Mercury Music Prize awards. I was saddened to see that young pop person Tinie Tempah, who was shortlisted, failed to win. Anyway, as I dabbed away my tears, it occurred to me to ask you if Master Tempah is in any way related to that other excellent tiny, Tiny Enid. Please enlighten me.</em></p>
  <p>Dear Tim, In this bewildering world it is critical that we can distinguish one tiny from another. Actually, that isn't strictly true, now I come to think of it. What matters is that we can tell Tiny Enid apart from all other extant tinies.</p>
  <p><strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archives/category/characters/tiny-enid" class="hootingyard">Tiny Enid</a></strong> is a heroic clubfooted infant, usually dressed in a polka dot frock, much given to brave, even reckless, deeds of derring-do, and of pronounced Fascist sympathies.</p>
  <p>I am not entirely sure who Tinie Tempah is, but I suspect he may be some kind of homunculus, possibly malevolent.</p>
  <p>I hope this clears the matter up to your satisfaction.</p>
