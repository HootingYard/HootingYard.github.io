  <h1>Placard of the Year</h1>
  <p>Whatever else you may say about them, Islamic protesters know how to brandish a good placard. Witness the slogan quoted above, which puts Western lefties with their “Bush 'n' Blair, Oooh We Hate You” vapidity to shame. Something about the one time Cardinal Ratzinger clearly inspires the perpetually-offended Islamists. His recent comments—sorry, unforgivable insults for which he deserves to be beheaded—about the iniquity of old Mohammed led to the creation of Hooting Yard's favourite placard of the year.</p>
