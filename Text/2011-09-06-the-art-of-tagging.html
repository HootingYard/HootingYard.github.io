  <h1 id="post-7215">The Art Of Tagging</h1>
  <p>For some reason, quite possibly ignorance, I have never made it my practice to add “tags” to Hooting Yard postages. I shove them into a category, but have always neglected the tags. It is not something I have thought about, until today, when I have realised that a skilled “tagger” can create something approaching poetry.</p>
  <p>The friend who I thumped on the bonce with the Hammer of Thumpiness, until she caved in and began blogging, is only six posts in at <strong><em><a href="http://blackberryjuniperandsherbet.blogspot.com/2011/09/rain-wind-old-memory.html" class="external">BlackberryJuniper And Sherbet</a></em></strong>, yet her grasp of tagging is a wonder to behold. Consider this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>memory</p>
    <p>rain</p>
    <p>Swanage</p>
    <p>wind</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>What a corker! Time, surely, to eject Carol Ann Duffy<strong>*</strong> from the Laureateship and appoint my friend in her stead.</p>
  <p><strong>* NOTE</strong>&nbsp;: The preposterous Duffy's latest <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/sep/05/carol-ann-duffy-poetry-texting-competition" class="external">witterings</a></strong> argue that teenpersons' txt-spk has poetic potential. Shouldn't she be promoting literacy rather than garbled barbarism?</p>
