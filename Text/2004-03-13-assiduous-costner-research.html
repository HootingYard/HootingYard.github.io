  <h1>Assiduous Costner Research</h1>
  <p>Reader Tim Thurn has complained that recent mentions of the film person Melvin Gibson, and more particularly his absurd <em>The Passion Of The Christ</em> (see 3rd &amp; 10th March, &amp; <em>passim</em>), indicate that I have lost sight of the supreme importance of Kevin Costner to world cinema. Fear not, Tim! I may not have prostrated myself before my Costner-shrine of late, but I have not been idle. Indeed, today I am able to announce that scholars have at last identified the source-novel of Costner's masterpiece:</p>

  <p>If you peer <em>very</em> closely at that upstairs window, behind the word <em>EASY</em>, you can just see a small mushroom cloud. Costner was, of course, faithful to the apocalyptic post-nuclear holocaust atmosphere of this fine book.</p>
