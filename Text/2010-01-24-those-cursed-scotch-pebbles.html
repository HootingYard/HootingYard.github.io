  <p>“I am sorry there are such occasions to clean your pebbles; you must make use of the powder to them by putting it in anything of substance, wherein it will not swim a-top of the water.”</p>
  <p>The father, feeling unwell, frequently took water gruel. This was a proper vehicle for the powder.</p>
  <p>“On Sunday morning, I again examined Mr Blandy. He seemed much relieved, but, on viewing his fundament, I found it almost surrounded with gleety excoriations and ulcers.”</p>
  <p>“I always thought there was mischief in those cursed Scotch pebbles.”</p>
  <p>Four extracts from an account of the case of <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Blandy" class="external">Mary Blandy</a></strong>, given in <em>Tales Of The Newgate Calendar</em> by Rayner Heppenstall (1981)</p>
