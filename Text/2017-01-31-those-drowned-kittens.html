  <h1>Those Drowned Kittens</h1>
  <p>The other day I <strong><a href="2017-01-28-songs-for-strangled-puppies.html" class="internal" title="Songs For Strangled Puppies">mentioned</a></strong> Biff Chomsky's chart-topping album of sentimental ballads entitled <em>Songs For Drowned Kittens</em>.</p>
  <p>By curious coincidence, yesterday I listened, for the first time in God knows how many years, to <em>One Lonely Night</em>. This is a “Cold War operetta” by The Massed Ranks Of The Proletariat, adapted from the novel by Mickey Spillane. The lyrics are by Ed Baxter. It was released as a severely-limited edition cassette tape in (I think) 1990.</p>
  <p>Anyway, have a listen to <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Mikes-death-wish-song.wav" class="hootingyard">Mike's death-wish song</a></strong>and you will understand why I was struck by a spooky sense of connection to the past.</p>
