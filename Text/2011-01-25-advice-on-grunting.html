  <p><em>Courtesy of <strong><a href="http://catsmeatshop.blogspot.com/2011/01/we-are-amused.html" class="external">The Cat's Meat Shop</a></strong>, some extremely detailed advice on grunting:</em></p>
  <p>Take the baby hand in one of yours. Spread out the hand. Point to the thumb, and say decidedly, yet confidingly –</p>
  <p>1. This little pig went to market.” <em>(Grunt and let it be an ordinary pig's grunt.)</em></p>
  <p>Point to the next finger and say, in the deepest bass you can assume –</p>
  <p>2. “This little pig stayed at home.” <em>(Give a morose bass grunt and frown.)</em></p>
  <p>Point to the next finger and say, with an insinuating tone and smile, elevating your eyebrows and bowing –</p>
  <p>3. “This little pig had roast beef” <em>(and add three quick little grunts of satisfaction.)</em></p>
  <p>Point to the next finger and say, in a voice just ready to cry –</p>
  <p>4. “This little pig had none.” <em>(Give two low grunts of weariness, and look ready to cry.)</em></p>
  <p>Then pointing to the little finger, say very pleasantly, in a shrill, droll voice, laughing meanwhile, “This little pig cried, ‘Tweak! tweak! tweak!'” pinching and twirling the child's finger gently, as if you had hold of the pig's tail.</p>
  <p>This makes a complete harmless drama of the story of the pigs, and rouses baby's feelings, sensations and ideas in a healthy manner. Five distinct emotions are raised: 1. Interest; 2. Fear; 3. Pleasure or sympathy; 4. Grief, almost to tears; 5. A sudden reversion to mirth, and “All's well that ends well,” a great desideratum in baby estimation. We must remember too, that the feelings during babyhood are ephemeral in the extreme, light and evanescent…</p>
