  <h1 id="post-93">The Horrible Cave</h1>
  <p>In the autumn of 2004 I wrote three episodes of a story entitled <em>The Horrible Cave</em>. It was left unfinished, but I always meant to get back to it, and now I have. Rather than sending readers back to the (unhelpfully indexed) archive for the first three parts, I decided to republish the whole thing here. So scroll down for all four episodes of… (sinister voice) … <em>The Horrible Cave!</em></p>
