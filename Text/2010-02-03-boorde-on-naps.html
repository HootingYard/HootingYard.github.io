  <h1 id="post-3831">Boorde On Naps</h1>
  <p>As a great enthusiast for the postprandial nap, which I like to think of as a mark of civilised behaviour, I was somewhat alarmed to read the advice of Dr Andrew Boorde, writing in his <em>Dyetary of Helth</em> in 1542: “Whole men of what age or complexion soever they be of, should take their natural rest and sleep in the night, and to eschew all meridial sleep. But, an need shall compel man to sleep upon his meat, let him make a pause, and then let him stand, and lean and sleep against a cupboard.”</p>
