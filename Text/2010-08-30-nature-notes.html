  <h1>Nature Notes</h1>
  <p>Another thing I found when <strong><a href="2010-08-27-graveyard-anecdote-with-nuns.html" class="internal" title="Graveyard Anecdote, With Nuns">fossicking in that cupboard</a></strong> was a scrap of paper on which was scribbled the following:</p>
  <p>11 Petiver, Buddle &amp; Doody. 48 Withering. 53 Rousseau's wife. 56 Huttonian theory. 63/64 Buckland. 76 Robert Dick—biscuit. 77/78 McGillivray's journey. 80 Philip Gosse diary entry. 82 Buckland concealed hammer on the Sabbath. 129 Discovery of plankton.</p>
  <p>Deploying my Holmesian deductive skills, I worked out that these were notes I had made, long ago, when reading <em>The Naturalist In Britain&nbsp;: A Social History</em> by David Elliston Allen (1976). Seeking enlightenment, I located the volume on the teetering bookshelves, and turned to the relevant pages. In some cases, it is no longer clear to me what sparked my interest. Others, however, I was extremely pleased to be reminded of. Here are the relevant quotes:</p>
  <p>“Rousseau's extreme short-sight was such that at the best of times he saw the landscape as a blur, while his wife, in similar fashion, never knew which day of the week it was and never even learned to tell the time.”</p>
  <p>“In many ways [Buckland] was undeniably a very curious person: an oddly truncated man… He sported childish jests and puns, devised peculiar contraptions, went in for the weirdest kinds of food… It was typical of him that he drove round in a special kind of carriage, strengthened in an ostentatious manner… he carried around a mysterious blue bag… he led his students on excursions into the field wearing quite incongruously formal clothes.”</p>
  <p>“Robert Dick… ‘the Botanist of Thurso’ made it his regular practice to walk all day, for up to forty miles, with one ship's biscuit as his only sustenance.”</p>
  <p>“Philip Henry Gosse became so lost in his work that he registered the birth of his only child with the remarkable entry in his diary: ‘Received green swallow from Jamaica. E delivered of a son.'”</p>
