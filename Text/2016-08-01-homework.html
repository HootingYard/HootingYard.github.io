  <h1 id="post-14760">Homework</h1>
  <p>Read and digest the piece <strong><em><a href="2016-08-01-collapsed-puffin.html" class="internal" title="Collapsed Puffin">Collapsed Puffin,</a></em></strong> below. Then reread it and redigest it. If necessary, rereread it and reredigest it. Now, using a sharpened pencil and a sheet of foolscap paper, write a variation of the piece from the point of view of the companion, Squiffy. You should aim to address the following matters:</p>
  <p>1. Why do you think the narrator keeps nagging Squiffy regarding his goggles, ear-corks, nasal icicles, and furry boots?</p>
  <p>2. Which of the pair do you think is the pilot of the chopper?</p>
  <p>3. Does the collapsed puffin actually exist or is it an hallucination borne of cold, exhaustion, or even piblokto?</p>
  <p>4. Do you think the narrator's love of puffins, guillemots, auks, and bonxies is sincere and unreserved, or is it an affectation?</p>
  <p>5. Can you recall any nursery rhymes in which bonxies appear?</p>
  <p>When you have finished, turn over the piece of foolscap paper and, on the reverse, write an even more compelling variation from the point of view of the collapsed puffin.</p>
