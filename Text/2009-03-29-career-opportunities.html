  <p>Yesterday I posted an extract from <em>The Devil's Party&nbsp;: A History Of Charlatan Messiahs</em> by Colin Wilson. Wilson is quite a maddening writer, slapdash and hurried, but I have to admire the way he litters his text with marvellously entertaining snippets of information. On page 73, for example, we learn that <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jones_(cult_leader)" class="external">Jim Jones</a></strong> of the People's Temple funded his early cult-building efforts by being a door-to-door monkey salesman.</p>
