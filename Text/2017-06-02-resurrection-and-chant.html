  <p>Crikey! I think that must be the longest period of eerie silence at Hooting Yard since records began fourteen years ago. Much has happened in the interim. Well … not <em>that</em> much. There has been ongoing eye trouble (not yet resolved), regular shows on Resonance—available on <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/playlists/hooting-yard/" class="external">Mixcloud</a></strong>—where I have been looking at past investigations of plums and swans and Captain Nitty, and a brief trip to Scotland. Oh, and I was asked to name a trawler.</p>
  <p>To ease you back in to what they call the Hooting Yard Experience, I bring you the work of Charles Anthony. I have no idea who Mr Anthony is, but he is clearly a very sensible man. Please take a minute to marvel at <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdcFReFvXOo" class="external">this</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiEzQJCkcCE" class="external">this</a></strong>.</p>
