  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Mr [James] Douglas would rather give a child prussic acid than allow it to read <em><a class="external" href="http://www.plaidder.com/loneliness.htm">The Well Of Loneliness</a></em>… I offered to provide Mr Douglas with a child, a bottle of prussic acid, a copy of <em>The Well Of Loneliness</em>, and—if he kept his word and chose to administer the acid—a handsome memorial in marble to be erected wherever he might appoint, after his execution. The offer, I regret to say, was not accepted.” — Aldous Huxley, <em>Music At Night &amp; Other Essays</em></p>
