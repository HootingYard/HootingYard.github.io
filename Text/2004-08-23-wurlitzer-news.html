  <h1>Wurlitzer News</h1>
  <p>This brief rummage through the Hooting Yard postbag ends with the following, from reader Peter Ross:</p>
  <p>While in Norfolk we went to something called ‘The Village Experience’. It was like a <em>League of Gentlemen</em> version of Legoland. Each of the so called rides, which only functioned every hour or so, was attended by a humpbacked man with a limp. There was also a large shed containing a Wurlitzer collection where we managed to catch a concert performed by a slightly odd teenager. The whole place looked like it had been built in the 1960s and never updated. In fact it would not have surprised me if the whole thing had been brought over from Plovdiv. Don't know why I have told you this, except that it had a certain Hooting Yard quality about it. Sadly the place is closing down in September.</p>
