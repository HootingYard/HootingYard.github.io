  <h1>Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich &amp; Wynken, Blynken &amp; Nod</h1>
  <p>Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick &amp; Tich one night in the wood encountered a witch. She was a bricklaying witch and she carried a hod. She asked “Which of you is Blynken, which Wynken, which Nod?” Beaky replied on behalf of the five, “That trio is fictional, but we are alive. They were invented for verse by Eugene Field.” With these words the fivesome's fate was sealed. The witch's countenance became twisted with hate and she cried “I'm his childhood sweetheart, Captivity Waite! He abandoned me, the cur, the dog, yet my name is immortalised in his autobiog, <em>Love Affairs Of A Bibliomaniac</em>“, and then, maddened, she started to whack Dave Dee and Dozy and Beaky and Mick and Tich with brick after brick after brick until in the wood in the dead of the night the soul of each pop star took heavenward flight. Their mortal lives gone, they sat next to God, despatched by the bricklaying witch with her hod.</p>
