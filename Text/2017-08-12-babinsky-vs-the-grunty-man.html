  <h1 id="post-15551">Babinsky vs. The Grunty Man</h1>
  <p>It is one of the enduring mysteries of contemporary life. How can it be, I hear you cry, that there is not a blockbusting Hollywood franchise based on Hooting Yard? Imagine for a moment that there existed a dimwitted action-packed film, filled with CGI explosions and the like, in the spirit of, say, <em>Alien vs. Predator,</em> but in this instance called <em>Babinsky vs. The Grunty Man</em>. Clearly the moviegoing hordes would be queueing up at multiplexes across the land to lose themselves for two and a half hours in such a spectacle. So why has Mr Key not yet had a call from a Hollywood mogul? It is, as I say, an enduring mystery.</p>
  <p>I am sure, too, that a film entitled <em>Tiny Enid&nbsp;: Plucky Tot</em> could spawn an endless string of sequels. Come on, Hollywood! Get your act together!</p>
  <p>To date, only the visionary film-maker Miss HatHorn has used Hooting Yard as her source. If you have not yet seen <a href="https://vimeo.com/80218060" class="external"><strong><em>A Recipe For Gruel</em>,</strong></a> watch it now.</p>
