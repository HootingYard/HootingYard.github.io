  <p>It occurred to me that no Advent Calendar for 2011 would be complete without one of Outa_Spaceman's pieces of cardboard signage. I chose this one, number 356, for the simple reason that it filled me with unalloyed glee. But you might have a different favourite, and as it is Christmas Eve, I think I will give you a treat. You can choose any one of the 357 signs currently in the <strong><a href="http://outaspaceman.blogspot.com/search/label/Cardboard" class="external">cardboard archive</a></strong>, print it out, cut around the edges, and paste it to your sheet of advent calendar cardboard with glue. Please leave a comment under the appropriate postage at Outa_Spaceman's <strong><a href="http://outaspaceman.blogspot.com/" class="external">Inexplicable World</a></strong> so he can keep a tally. He may not wish to keep a tally, but let us at least give him the opportunity to do so.</p>
