  <h1 id="post-15422">The Nylon Duke</h1>
  <p>Behold the Nylon Duke. He is fashioned entirely from nylon, every last bit of him, yea, even unto his cartilages. He is a nylon wonder of the world.</p>
  <p>The Nylon Duke is pulled along, flat on his back, on a cart, by a great grey drayhorse with its bright and battering sandal, from village to village. At each stop along the way, in villages leafy or otherwise, he is hoisted upright by a system of winches and pulleys. The villagers gather and gasp and gawp at the sight of the Nylon Duke. They bring offerings of potatoes and similar root vegetables, piled high on the cart before being transferred into sacks by the Nylon Duke's attendants. These attendants are not made of nylon.</p>
  <p>Elsewhere, there is a Nylon Duchess, and there may be a Nylon Dauphin, and there are even rumours of a Nylon Dunce. But in this land there are not enough great grey drayhorses to pull them on carts around villages. <em>A Dearth Of Drayhorses</em> is an oft-reprinted tract which goes some way to explaining this situation.</p>
  <p>Consider the Nylon Duke in the round, in all his pomp and finery and nylonosity. Would you begrudge him your potatoes? Think hard before you answer, for <em>fig eider remprent, scou binder ad fig</em>, as it is written, as it is engraved, as it is tattooed upon the foreheads of the attendants.</p>
  <p>The Nylon Duke's given name is Bob.</p>
