  <p>Yes, yes, I realise I am blundering into the World o' Advent Calendars four days late. Just bear in mind that my health is pitiful and I have the eyesight of a mole, and bear with me. What we are going to do is to jump-start the calendar with four postages today, and you can pretend they have appeared with rigorous regularity since the beginning of the month. I shall endeavour to post the rest of them daily until Christmas or, as John and Yoko would have it, until war is over.</p>
  <p>All these birds come from the collection of Andy Martin, tyrannical leader of UNIT, to whom many many thanks.</p>
