  <p>On the occasion of her 184th birthday, I am reminded of my long-abandoned project of concocting an entirely new corpus of works by Emily Dickinson, through the simple procedure of jumbling up lines from her poems more or less at random. Perhaps reviving this scheme will keep me occupied during my (imminent) dotage. Here is a sample:</p>

  Its little Ether Hood<br />
  Between my Curtain and the Wall<br />
  Had power to mangle me</p>
