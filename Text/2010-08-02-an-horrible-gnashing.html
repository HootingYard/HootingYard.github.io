  <h1 id="post-4914">An Horrible Gnashing</h1>
  <p>Forgive me for returning to Pliny's <em>Natural History</em> yet again. Here (in Philomen Holland's English translation of 1634) he is surely describing the tribe or grouplet which spawned the Grunty Man:</p>
  <p>“<em>Tauron</em> writeth, That the Choromandae are a savage and wild people: distinct voice and speech they have none, but in stead thereof, they keep an horrible gnashing and hideous noise: rough they are and hairy all over their bodies, eies they have red like the houlets, and toothed they be like dogs.”</p>
  <p>Earlier, I cannot remember where, I have said that the Grunty Man is older than the Earth itself, but now I may have to revise that statement in the finished version of my ten thousand page biography <em>The Life And Times Of The Grunty Man!</em> (The exclamation point in the title is quite deliberate, and intended to impart a sense of excitement to what is otherwise, I have to say, quite a dull narrative, consisting as it does chiefly of scenes in which the Grunty Man grunts from within his grim dark foul-smelling lair, century after century.)</p>
