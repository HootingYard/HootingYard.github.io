  <h1 id="post-10679">Hooting Yard Haiku</h1>
  <p>In my debilitated state, felled by germs and much given to whimpering, writing one thousandish words upon any subject at all is quite beyond me. On the other hand, if readers are to read then writers must write. It occurred to me that I might just manage to bash out a few haiku, distillations in a few words of what we could call the Hooting Yardanschauung.</p>
  <p class="verse">A bog<br />
  Beyond the viaduct<br />
  In the downpour</p>
  <p class="verse">Dobson<br />
  At his escritoire<br />
  Scribbling twaddle</p>
  <p class="verse">A hobgoblin<br />
  On Sawdust Bridge<br />
  Eating a sausage</p>
  <p class="verse">Tiny Enid<br />
  Flooring a ne'er-do-well<br />
  And kicking his head in</p>
  <p>There are four for you to pore over. There may be more to come. Now for the Lemsip!</p>
