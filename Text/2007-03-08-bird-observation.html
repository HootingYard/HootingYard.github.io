  <h1 id="post-103">Bird Observation</h1>
  <p>Pansy Cradledew reports that a pigeon, or possibly a cumulet, has become a regular visitor to her sixteenth-floor windowsill. The curious thing about this pigeon is that it spends all its time on these visits standing on one leg. Pansy wonders if this is normal pigeon behaviour, or if her visitor is some sort of avian Ian Anderson, legendary fish farmer and flautist of Jethro Tull, who was of course noted for playing his flute while perched on one leg. I suggested that the best way to test this theory was to whittle a twig into a rudimentary bird flute, lodge it in the bird's beak, and wait to hear what mellifluous sounds may emerge. I shall keep readers apprised of the results of this important experiment.</p>
