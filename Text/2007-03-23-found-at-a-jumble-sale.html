  <h1 id="post-133">Found At A Jumble Sale</h1>
  <p>At a jumble sale last week, I was delighted to pick up a bundle of Dennis Beerpint poetry books for less than the price of a toffee apple. Well, I say books, but these are leaflets really, of between four and twelve pages each, printed with a Gestetner machine in the early 1970s. Here at Hooting Yard we think Beerpint is a criminally overlooked versifier, often subjected to critical maulings when he ought justly be garlanded with laurels.</p>
  <p>Much of the material in these forgotten publications sees Beerpint finding his voice, and admittedly that voice was still a little shaky at this early stage in his career. I was struck, however, by the odd gem such as <em>Illness</em>, which begins:</p>
  <p><em>Oh how dark the night is / When you've got meningitis</em></p>
  <p>and by <em>Being A Bee</em>, with its wonderfully evocative couplet</p>
  <p><em>I do as I do and I does as I does / And what I do and does is buzz</em></p>
  <p>I think it is lines like these that fool people into thinking Beerpint “twee”, or a peddler of doggerel. This seems a particularly fatuous accusation when one considers titanic works of poesy such as <em>Lines Upon The Death Of Dag Hammarskjöld In A Plane Crash (September 1961)</em>, with its vibrant “pluckety-pluck” rhythms, massive resonance, reach, vigour, gargantuan ambition, deliberately blurred vision, knock-kneed tremblement, sourness, decisively windswept atmosphere, implacability, tartness, muscular bounding strides, and bravery in confronting, head-on, conundrums of global significance. It ends with this Beerpintian flourish:</p>
  <p><em>O Dag! Alenda lux ubi orta libertas / I've reserved a pew at your Requiem Mass</em></p>
  <p>Who else could have written that?</p>
