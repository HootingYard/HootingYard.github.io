  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Here, on this very floor, under that elevated and decorated vault, in a “dim religious light” like this, but with the darkness of the shadow of death in their souls, they prostrated themselves to their saints, or their “queen of heaven;” nay, to painted images and toys of wood or wax, to some ounce or two of bread and wine, to fragments of old bones, and rags of cast-off vestments.” — John Foster, <em>An Essay On The Evils Of Popular Ignorance</em></p>
