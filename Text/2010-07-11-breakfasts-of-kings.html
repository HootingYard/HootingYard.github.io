  <h1 id="post-4732">Breakfasts Of Kings</h1>
  <p>This is the first in our important series “Breakfasts Of Kings” in which we cast a beady eye on the breakfast preferences of various monarchs throughout history.</p>
  <p>King Leopold II of Belgium ate six poached eggs, an enormous number of slices of toast, and an entire jar of marmalade for his breakfast each day.</p>
  <p>Leopold spoke French, rather than Flemish, so he did not refer to his breakfast as “het ontbijt”, as Mr Key does, usually.</p>
  <p><strong>ADDENDUM&nbsp;:</strong> It concerns not just breakfast but every daily meal, and it is not a king writing, but this quotation from the journals of Roger Casement is worth noting: “Chicken, chicken, custard, custard… every day… Goddam”. Casement's meals at the time (1903) were prepared by a cook known only as “Hairy Bill”.</p>
