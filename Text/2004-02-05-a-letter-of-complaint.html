  <h1>A Letter of Complaint</h1>
  <p>Reader Judith Winch writes&nbsp;:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Mr Key&nbsp;: I discovered your site while searching for Xavier Cugat—it seems your so-called “<a href="2003-01-01-the-hootingyard-search-engine-lure.html" class="internal">search engine lure</a>” works—and I have become a regular visitor. Since the new year I have looked forward to “calling in” at Hooting Yard on Sunday evenings to see what new material has been added over the past seven days. I particularly like the “Decoy Duck of the Week” feature, and am irritated that the name is a misnomer, as some weeks go by with no sign of a decoy duck at all. Please rectify this situation, or you risk losing a reader who might otherwise be described as “devoted (possibly)”.</p>

  <p>I am happy to oblige!</p>
