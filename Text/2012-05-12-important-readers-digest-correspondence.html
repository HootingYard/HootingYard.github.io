  <h1>Important <em>Reader's Digest</em> Correspondence</h1>
  <p><em>A letter arrives in the post:</em></p>
  <div class="blockparagraphs">
  <p>Dear Mr Key</p>
  <p>I was interested to read your <strong><a href="2012-05-11-on-brains.html" class="internal" title="On Brains">comments</a></strong> about <em>The Readers' Digest</em>, which was a formative influence when I was growing up also. An ancient companion of my late grandmother lived with us, and was a subscriber: she would leave copies outside her door when she'd finished with them and we all pounced on them with glee. As well as the magazines, she received a 78 rpm record every month from some sort of listening-club associated with the publisher, and my brother and I were intrigued by these, as she never allowed us to hear them (though we endured endless Caruso, Bing Crosby and The Spooncat 5 on her wind-up gramophone). She explained that the <em>Readers' Digest</em> records always got broken in the post, and we never wondered why she didn't simply cancel the subscription.</p>
  <p>She's been gone for decades; but her wind-up gramophone remained, and when we were cleaning it up recently to send it to auction we found just one of those white-label <em>Readers' Digest</em> 78s, still extant in a thin drawer in the base of the machine. It's lo-fi stuff—and pretty tame these days—but I've recorded the ‘with vocal refrain’ section in hopes that it will be of interest to your readers. I used ‘declicking’ software to remove most of the surface hiss but there's no curing the damage at the end. Doubtless we have the Royal Mail to thank for that.</p>
  <p>Best wishes<br />
    Roland Clare</p>
