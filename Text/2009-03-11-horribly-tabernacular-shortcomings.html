  <p>“It happens that here and there a word, or some peculiarity in using a word, indicates, in this author, a Scotchman;… the word <em>shortcomings</em>, which, being horribly tabernacular, and such that no gentleman could allow himself to touch it without gloves, it is to be wished that our Scottish brethren would resign, together with <em>backslidings</em>, to the use of field-preachers.”</p>
  <p>Thomas De Quincey, “Protestantism”, T<em>ait's Edinburgh Magazine,&nbsp;</em>1847</p>
  <p>Incidentally, <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lodowicke_Muggleton" class="external">Lodowicke Muggleton</a></strong> had a pathological hatred of Scotchmen, who often found themselves on the receiving end of Muggletonian curses.&nbsp;</p>
