  <h1 id="post-12562">Fab!</h1>
  <p>Reading about yet another <strong><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/23/east-london-shooting-death-schoolgirl-named-shereka-marsh" class="external">teenage shooting murder</a></strong> in east London in yesterday's paper, I could not help but burst into inappropriate laughter at the name of the victim. Her name, apparently, was Shereka Fab-Ann Marsh. “Shereka” is bad enough, eliding easily into “Shrieker”, but “Fab-Ann”? What on earth were her parents thinking?</p>
  <p>I am not sure if it is possible for me to re-register the births of my own (now adult) sons, but I am tempted to rechristen them Fab-Sam and Fab-Ed. And while we are about it, could I become Fab-Frank? Or perhaps With-It-Mr-Key?</p>
  <p>Perhaps the tragic Miss Marsh's parents were fans of <em>Thunderbirds</em>.</p>
