  <p>You lot do not visit Hooting Yard for news of the latest doings in the world of pop culture, but this, I think, is worth noting:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The ballads are seldom the high point of a huge pop show, but in [Miley] Cyrus's case, a degree of interest is added by the fact that she sings one of them while being pursued around the stage, for reasons that aren't entirely clear, by a giant fluorescent orange fluffy bird.</p>
