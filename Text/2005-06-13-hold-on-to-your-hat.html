  <h1>Hold on to Your Hat</h1>
  <p>He's back! He's making grunty noises! It's the Grunty Man! Just when you thought it was safe to let go of your hat, June sees the return of the very very frightening Grunty Man, who stalks your nightmares, makes his grunty noises, and then stalks some more. Well may you shudder, milksop! Shudder as much as you like, but make sure you hold on to your hat. It has been known for centuries that holding on to your hat is an effective way of stopping it flying off your head as you quake in fear, something we have seen happen so often in times of terror. And no time is more terrible than the time when the Grunty Man comes a-stalking, making his grunty noises. But wait! If you are in the habit of dyeing your hat, make sure the dye is dry before you hold it, or you will get dye on your hand, and being so marked, the Grunty Man will sniff you out as he comes stalking and grunting and you will be fodder for his maw.</p>
  <p><em>The Passion Of The Grunty Man</em> opens at the Excelsior Cinema, O'Houlihan's Wharf, very very soon.</p>
