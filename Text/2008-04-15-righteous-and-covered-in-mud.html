  <h1 id="post-400">Righteous, And Covered In Mud</h1>
  <p>“Here's the way I want to show up at the gates of heaven. I want to come skidding in there on all fours. I want to be slipping and sliding and I want to hit the gates of heaven with a bang. And when I stand up, when I stand before Christ, I want there to be blood on my knees, and my elbows. I want to be covered with mud. And I want to be standing there with a ragged breastplate of righteousness, and a spear in my hand. And I want to say, ‘look at me, Jesus, I've been in the battles, I've been fighting for you’.”—Retired Lieutenant-General William Boykin, addressing a conference of apocalyptic Christian Zionists, April 2008.</p>
