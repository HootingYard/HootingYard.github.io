  <p>It surprised me to learn that the good people of the New England state of Maine are raising their tinies to become Marxist-Leninist firebrands. But Mr Mike Jennings has sent me incontrovertible evidence from the Maine Organic Farmers And Growers Fall Fair, showing tots being forced to rehearse <em>10,000 Nails In The Coffin Of Imperialism</em> (1971) by Cornelius Cardew.</p>
  <p>A complete recording of the piece was made by Mr Key with Miss Dimity Cashew in 2011. You can listen to it here:</p>
