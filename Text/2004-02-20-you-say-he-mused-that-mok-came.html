  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“‘You say,’ he mused, ‘that Mok came from some land once ravaged by war in which for five hundred years literacy had been a monopoly of the priesthood, in which the inhabitants lived in stone huts, and they were unfamiliar with bow-ties?’” — Dennis Plimmer, <em>Man From The Wrong Time-Track</em></p>
