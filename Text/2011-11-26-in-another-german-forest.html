  <h1 id="post-7707">In Another German Forest</h1>
  <p>In another German forest, tenebrous and dense</p>
  <p>I stumbled through the duff until I reached a fence</p>
  <p>I followed the fence for miles, rattling a stick</p>
  <p>Was ever there a forest with German trees so thick?</p>
  <p>Was ever there a hiking Herr as thick as myself?</p>
  <p>The fence led me directly to the dwelling of an elf</p>
  <p>It was an elf of untold sin, its heart as black as pitch</p>
  <p>And with a hideous cackle it shoved me in a ditch</p>
  <p>I crawled through the ditch but the trees grew thicker still</p>
  <p>The sky was blotted out and I began to feel quite ill</p>
  <p>I was undone by a German elf in a forest dark and drear</p>
  <p>And all because I did not have the proper hiking gear</p>
  <p>So get your boots from Hubermann's, and your compass too</p>
  <p>Or else you'll get stuck in the woods of Woohoohoodiwoo</p>
