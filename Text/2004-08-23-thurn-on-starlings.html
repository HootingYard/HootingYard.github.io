  <h1>Thurn on Starlings</h1>
  <p>Also referring to last Wednesday is Tim Thurn. I am unable to quote his letter verbatim, as it was one of those increasingly rare letters written with pen and ink on paper, placed in an envelope with a stamp on it, and delivered to Hooting Yard by a postman<span class="asterisk">*</span>, and I inadvertently threw it away. The gist of Tim's scribbled note was that the illustration of a starling only showed a side view. What, he asks, does the other side look like? This seems at first to be a fatuous question, but perhaps Tim is on to something. Here is the other side of a starling:</p>
  <div class="illustration">
    <p class="imagerow"><img src="../Images/2004-08-starling1.jpg" alt="Thurn on Starlings: Starling1" class="medium" /></p>
  </div>
  <p><span class="mark">* NOTE&nbsp;:</span> The postman who delivered Tim's letter was not <em>The Postman</em>, as played by Kevin Costner in that foolish, foolish film, although there are times when, looking out of the window, one could be forgiven for thinking that a nuclear holocaust had already happened..</p>
