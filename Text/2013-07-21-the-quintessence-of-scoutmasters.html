  <h1>The Quintessence Of Scoutmasters</h1>
  <p>A snippet from <em>Memoirs Of A Public Baby</em> by <strong><a href="2013-07-21-the-man-who-stood-behind-the-door-and-said-boo-to-t-s-eliot.html" class="internal" title="The Man Who Stood Behind The Door And Said “Boo!” To T.S. Eliot">Philip O'Connor</a></strong>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The hut on the hill was in a fairly detached part of a holiday camp, the most “select” of several on this hill in Surrey. The signs of this selectiveness were the wide spaces between the huts; their decorum in colour and lack of fantasy in architecture; and the absence of radios (though the loudspeaker was still young), and the quality and size of the cars arriving at week-ends; and the good-quality plus-fours of the younger set. They were, in fact, of the class most disliked by my guardian, mostly prosperous shopkeepers, with a sprinkling of teachers, whom he also didn't like. It fairly pleased him not to like anyone in the camp except a certain scoutmaster. This was the quintessence of scoutmasters, and I feel certain he came from Roehampton, because of a particular greenhouse wildness in his appearance (I caught him acquiring a tropical tan artfully behind a bush once). He liked to stand most erect on the brow of the plateau and scan the horizon, eyes narrowed, ready, I believe, for eventualities.</p>
