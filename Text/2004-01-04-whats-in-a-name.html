  <h1>What's in a Name?</h1>
  <p>At Hooting Yard we have a pantheon of saints, characters past and present, fictional and factual, to whom we award the Tin Badge of Tantarabim, or even the Button of Beb. Every now and then potted biographies of such figures will appear here. One lost hero to whose cult we have never subscribed, however, is James Dean. It's not so much active dislike as indifference—sorry, James. I mention this only because, apropos of nothing at all, I have always been delighted by the name of the other driver involved in Dean's fatal car crash in 1955—one DONALD TURNUPSEED, no less. (Turnupseed survived the crash and died peacefully forty years later.)</p>
