  <p>Yesterday I received an annoying email from a company—probably run by teenagers—called SOS.</p>
  <p><em>Hi Frank!,</em> it began, overfamiliarly. I don't know why I continued reading after such effrontery, but I did.</p>
  <p><em>Here at SOS we're passionate about helping you maximise traffic to your website. SOS stands for Search Optimisation Solutions, and that's exactly what we do!</em></p>
  <p>Like a fool, I carried on reading. I suppose I was won over by the thought that I could attract more than thirty-four readers. I became even more interested when SOS gave me one of their so-called “simple yet effective” tips without my having to pay them a penny.</p>
  <p><em>Our research shows that web traffic increases a millionfold if you mention three names on your site. We call them The Three Ks—Kate, Kim, and Keith. That is, Kate Middleton, Kim Kardashian, and Keith Potger.</em></p>
  <p>I am now racking my brains trying to work out how to concoct a story which includes the Duchess of Cambridge, the inexplicable celebrity, and a quarter of Antipodean 1960s pop sensations The Seekers, which is at once (a) credible, (b) morally uplifting, and (c) groovy. If any of the thirty-four of you have any ideas, please let me know in the Comments.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>&nbsp;: Gosh! Since I posted the above, an hour ago, traffic to Hooting Yard has increased to a whopping thirty-six! Thanks a million, SOS!</p>
