  <h1>No More Soup, Ever</h1>
  <p>We already knew about Richard Milhous Nixon's love of <strong><a href="2007-02-04-presidential-pastimes.html" class="internal" title="Presidential Pastimes">mashed potatoes</a></strong>. Now, thanks to Salim Fadhley, we learn of his diametrically opposite view of soup. Mr Fadhley pointed me to this passage from <em>President Nixon&nbsp;: Alone In The White House</em> by Richard Reeves (2001):</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>. . .on March 24 [1969], the President hosted his first state dinner, for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau of Canada. He complained to Haldeman about it the next morning&nbsp;: “We've got to speed up these dinners. They take forever. So why don't we just leave out the soup course?”</p>
    <p>“Well. . .” Haldeman began.</p>
    <p>Nixon cut him off&nbsp;: “Men don't really like soup.”</p>
    <p>On a hunch, the chief of staff called the President's valet, Manolo Sanchez, and asked&nbsp;: “Was there anything wrong with the President's suit after that dinner last night?”</p>
    <p>“Yes. He spilled soup down the vest.”</p>
    <p>The action memo went out&nbsp;: No more soup, ever.</p>
