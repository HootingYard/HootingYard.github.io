  <h1>The Diligent Counting Of Squirrels</h1>
  <p>In homage to George Orwell's <a href="2008-11-28-ova.html" class="internal" title="Ova"><strong>egg</strong></a> <a href="2008-12-28-egg-update.html" class="internal" title="Egg Update"><strong>counting</strong></a> mania, I decided it would be an excellent idea to begin the new year by launching—to much fanfare, of course—Frank Key's Squirrel Count™. I can think of nothing that would excite readers quite as much as learning how many squirrels I have seen each day. So, to the sound of tooting horns and shrill whistle-blasts, with flags and banners flying, and perhaps some clowns cavorting upon a specially-built platform, here is the very first bulletin from Frank Key's Squirrel Count™ 2009.</p>
  <p>01.01.09 Six squirrels, or possibly three squirrels each seen twice.</p>
