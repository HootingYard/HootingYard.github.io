  <h1 id="post-14094">Birdsong</h1>
  <p>I have decided to devote my life to birdsong. No, not that kind of birdsong, all those trills and squawks and cooing noises that birds make. I mean songs about birds. I have not quite worked everything out in my head, but the general idea is to take familiar songs, not originally about birds, and to amend the lyrics to make them more bird-focussed. I feel this would provide an invaluable musical service for both humans and birds. As an example, here is the first fruit of my project, a rewrite of David Bowie's 1979 hit <em>Boys Keep Swinging</em>. I hope you will agree that this revised version is superior in every way, particularly from an ornithological point of view.</p>
  
  <div class="verse">
  <p>Heaven loves ya<br />
  The clouds part for ya<br />
  Nothing stands in your way<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>Plumage regales ya<br />
  Life is a pop of the cherry<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>When you're a grebe<br />
  You can soar through the air<br />
  When you're a grebe<br />
  Other grebes check you out<br />
  You get a fish<br />
  These are your favourite things<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>Grebes<br />
  Grebes<br />
  Grebes keep swinging<br />
  Grebes always work it out</p>
  
  <p>Uncage the colours<br />
  Unfurl the flag<br />
  Luck just kissed you hello<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>They'll never clone ya<br />
  You're always first on the line<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>When you're a grebe<br />
  You can dabble about on a pond<br />
  When you're a grebe<br />
  Learn to dive and everything<br />
  You'll get your share<br />
  When you're a grebe</p>
  
  <p>Grebes<br />
  Grebes<br />
  Grebes keep swinging<br />
  Grebes always work it out</p>
