  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“My mother opened a select private school for instruction in the art of changing the spots upon leopard-skin rugs; my eldest brother, George Henry, who had a turn for music, became a bugler in a neighbouring asylum for deaf mutes; my sister, Mary Maria, took orders for Professor Pumpernickel's Essence of Latchkeys for flavouring mineral springs; and I set up as an adjuster and gilder of crossbeams for gibbets. The other children, too young for labour, continued to steal small articles exposed in front of shops, as they had been taught. In our intervals of leisure we decoyed travellers into our house and buried the bodies in a cellar.” — Ambrose Bierce, <em>A Bottomless Grave</em></p>
