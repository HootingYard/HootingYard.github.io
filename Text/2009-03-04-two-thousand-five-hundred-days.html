  <h1 id="post-1981">Two Thousand Five Hundred Days</h1>
  <p>News bulletins often try to add drama to stories by announcing, in excitable tones, “Blizzard Britain—Day Four!” or “Pigeon Crisis—Day Two!” Once in a while, however, such an approach is justified, as it is today, with “<strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/archives/1073" class="external">Resonance FM—Day Two Thousand Five Hundred!</a></strong>”</p>
  <p>We should all throw our hats in the air and cheer at this achievement. Given that on an unlikely number of those days &nbsp;the station has played host to <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>, I ought to take this opportunity to thank the powers that be at the benevolent dictatorship that is Resonance, as well as the many sound engineers who have ensured my babbling is audible to the world.</p>
  <p>You can thank them too, by <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/" class="external">listening</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/" class="external">donating</a></strong> and buying things from the <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/shop/" class="external">shop</a></strong>.</p>
