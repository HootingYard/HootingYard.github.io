  <p>Blimey! That was a bloody awful start to the year. On New Year's Eve I began to feel as sick as a particularly sick dog, and I then spent most of January sprawled in bed, moaning weakly. Only in the past few days do I at last seem to be recovering my pep, or what passes for pep in these parts.</p>
  <p>It now behooves me to set Hooting Yard back on course after a whole month of silence. To this end, I have devised a foolhardy scheme, a planned series of interconnected pieces o' prose, none of which I have yet written. We shall see how that pans out in the coming weeks.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, I ought to draw to your attention the annual <a href="https://fundraiser.resonance.fm/" class="external"><strong>fundraiser</strong></a> at ResonanceFM, in the hope that you will give generously. You lot may be particularly interested in bidding for this year's Hooting Yard <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/323045716616?clk_rvr_id=1430411292525&amp;rmvSB=true" class="external"><strong>auction item</strong></a>, a unique bespoke paperback to be issued in an edition of one.</p>
  <p>I shall try to be back tomorrow, with some new prose …</p>
