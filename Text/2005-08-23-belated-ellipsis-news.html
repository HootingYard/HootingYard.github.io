  <h1>Belated Ellipsis News</h1>
  <p>I have just learned, too late, that yesterday was National Punctuation Day. Well, it was in the United States of Pining &amp; Pothorst Land<span class="asterisk">*</span>. That being so, the <a class="external" href="http://nationalpunctuationday.com/">website</a> is emblazoned with patriotic flags, refers to <em>periods</em> rather than <em>full stops</em>, has a picture of “National Punctuation Day Founder” Jeff Rubin wearing a vest down at the gym, is littered with ®s wherever you look, and seems to be aimed primarily at the “business community”. I can only sigh. Peter Blegvad once “dreamed of a world where accountants are rarer than poets”. Would that it were so.</p>
  <p>Anyway, I came upon Jeff Rubin's gym vest &amp;c. via the link at <a class="external" href="http://www.languagehat.com/">languagehat.com</a>, which also points us in the direction of this rather splendid <a class="external" href="http://www.completetranslation.com/punctuation.htm">history of punctuation</a>.</p>
