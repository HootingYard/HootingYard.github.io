  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Rusterich, one of the Teutonic gods, was found in an excavation… The head was made of metal and contained a pot of water. The mouth and another hole in the forehead being stopped by wooden plugs, a fire of charcoal was lighted under this pot of water, and at length the steam drove out the plugs with a great noise, and the god was shrouded in a mist of steam which concealed him from his astonished worshippers.” — John Sutherland Sinclair, <em>Lectures On Popular And Scientific Subjects</em></p>
