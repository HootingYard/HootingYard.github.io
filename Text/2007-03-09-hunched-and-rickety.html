  <h1>Hunched &amp; Rickety</h1>
  <p><em>From <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Likes-Us-Biography-White-Working/dp/1862077789/ref=sr_1_1/203-7045760-7406340?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1173430842&amp;sr=1-1" class="external"><strong>The Likes Of Us</strong></a> by Michael Collins:</em></p>
  <p>Edwin Pugh was a slum novelist who attempted to insert a layer of sympathy between the hooliganism and the hangings. A former city clerk, Pugh was notable for lighting up the nether worlds of which he wrote with pathos and humour, even when the subject is a child with a hunched body, rickety legs, a flute-playing, philosopher father who seldom works, and a mother who drinks herself into oblivion, or at least the nearest kerb. Such is the content of <em>Tony Drum, A Cockney Boy</em> (1898).</p>
