  <p>Dan Chambers alerts me to <strong><a href="http://www.amazon.com/review/product/B00032G1S0" class="external">this</a></strong>. Do people really buy mik from Amazon? Do they really write reviews of the milk they buy? Are those reviews really such utter twaddle? It is often said that Hooting Yard is “a bit weird” or “eccentric” or “odd”, but the so-called “real world” is a much, much stranger place.</p>
