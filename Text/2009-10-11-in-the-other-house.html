  <p>It is reasonably well known that, while her husband was imagining “no possessions”, Yoko Ono maintained a separate apartment solely in which to keep her collection of fur coats. Perhaps she still does.</p>
  <p>The one-time popstrel Toyah Willcox, or Mrs Fripp as we like to think of her, owns a house which is used to store her ever-growing archive of memorabilia. Every last scrap of evidence of Mrs Fripp's existence on earth, in all media, is contained in a sort of Uber Toyah Silo, which, from the outside, looks just like an ordinary house. Strange, but true.</p>
  <p>It has now come to light that Dobson, the twentieth century's greatest out of print pamphleteer, also had a building other than his residence—possibly a barn, or a chalet—but we have no idea what he kept in there. Furs? Frippabilia? It'th a mythtery, sure enough.</p>
  <p>I shall do some research.</p>
