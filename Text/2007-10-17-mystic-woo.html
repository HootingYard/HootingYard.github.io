  <p>It's easy to be cynical about the idea of reincarnation, and even easier to mock the countless websites devoted to mystic woo in all its forms. But today I had what platitudinists would term a “wake up call”. At <a href="http://www.thebigview.com/pastlife/" class="external"><strong>Past Life Analysis</strong></a>, you will find a simple “analysis program” to answer the question “Who were you in your last life?” It looks idiotic, and I do not recommend reading the Disclaimer, but when I entered my birthdate I was flabbergasted to get this result:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <div class="blockparagraphs">
    <p><strong><tt>Your past life diagnosis:</tt></strong></p>

    <p><tt>I don't know how you feel about it, but you were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were a fictional athlete, a sprinter and pole-vaulter named Bobnit Tivol, and you won many tin medals under the guidance of a cantankerous chain-smoking coach called Old Halob.</tt></p>

    <p><strong><tt>Your brief psychological profile in your past life:</tt></strong></p>

    <p> <tt>Seeker of cakes and celery pie. You could have had great insight into ancient Etruscan soap-making techniques. Others perceived you as a pioneering prophet of Edward De Bono's revolutionary “Six Hats Thinking System”, even though you only had two hats.</tt></p>

    <p><strong><tt>The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation:</tt></strong></p>

      <p> <tt>You fulfil your lesson by taking well-earned naps. You came to this life to learn to brim with compassionate intensity whenever you contemplate the spindly inmates of Pang Hill Orphanage.</tt></p>

    <p><tt>Do you remember now?</tt></p>
    </div>
  </blockquote>

  <p>To which the answer is&nbsp;: Great Heavens to Betsy, I do!</p>
