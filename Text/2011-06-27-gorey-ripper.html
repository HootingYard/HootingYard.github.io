  <p>A further snippet from <em>Sober Truth&nbsp;: A Collection Of Nineteenth-Century Episodes, Fantastic, Grotesque And Mysterious</em> compiled and edited by Margaret Barton and Osbert Sitwell (1930) reveals that the hunt for Jack the Ripper was a scene from Edward Gorey:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whitechapel bristled with policemen, whose work was rendered infinitely more difficult by the swarms of amateur detectives from the West End. Medical students and newspaper reporters paraded the streets unconvincingly disguised as women, and in every corner there lurked assassin-hunters in tennis shoes or galoshes.</p>
