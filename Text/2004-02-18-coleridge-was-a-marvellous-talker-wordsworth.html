  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Coleridge was a marvellous talker … Wordsworth and I called upon him one forenoon, when he was in a lodging off Pall Mall. He talked uninterruptedly for about two hours, during which Wordsworth listened to him with profound attention, every now and then nodding his head as if in assent. On quitting the lodging, I said to Wordsworth, 'Well, for my own part, I could not make head or tail of Coleridge's oration: pray, did you understand it?' ‘Not one syllable of it’, was Wordsworth's reply.” — Samuel Rogers, <em>Table Talk</em></p>
