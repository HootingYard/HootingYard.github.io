  <p>I have had a fabtastic idea for a TV show. It's called <em>Wankers On Hovercrafts</em>. Each episode would follow a channel crossing, there and back, by a group of objectionable people aboard an outmoded form of sea transport. The idea ticks all the boxes—well, three of them—and would be relatively cheap to produce. I shall set up a meeting with a BBC commissioning editor at the first opportunity, and I have every confidence that it will get the go-ahead. I mean, it's the perfect TV show, surely? When you see me collecting my gong at a future awards ceremony, remember where you first read those magic words—<em>Wankers On Hovercrafts</em>!</p>
