  <h1 id="post-7614">Magnetic Cows</h1>
  <p>Many thanks to Salim Fadhley for drawing to my attention <strong><a href="http://doubtfulnews.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/scientific-question-of-magnetically-aligned-cows-still-unanswered/" class="external">this whole flapdoodle</a></strong> about magnetically aligned cows. Personally, I have always been convinced of the unbreakable link between cows and magnetism, ever since an episode in a field during a picnic when I was a child. The memory grows dim, for I was but tiny, but magnets and cows were both involved, inextricably, I think. My father, too, and one of my sisters, and a priest who had joined us for the picnic, clad in his black soutane, but non-magnetic. If I could recall the exact date I could check the weather conditions pertaining at the time, if, that is, I could remember precisely where we were, at picnic, near cows, and magnets.</p>
