  <h1>Istvan &amp; Zoltan</h1>
  <p>On Monday 8th March we published one of Dobson's so-called “ghost photographs”, thought to be the only extant picture of those tiresome yet strangely attractive twins, Istvan &amp; Zoltan, whose madcap escapades have thrilled a handful of readers. But Dr Ruth Pastry has news for us. “I was clearing out one of the leisure-and-relaxation module-compartments in my space-age home,” she writes, “to make room for my new collection of <em>The Passion Of The Christ</em>-related <a class="external" href="http://www.sharethepassionofthechrist.com/gifts.asp">merchandise</a>, when I came upon a little book called <em>Jimmy At The Seaside</em> by Neville Main, published by the Brockhampton Press in 1949. Imagine my surprise when, leafing through it, my eyes fell upon some pictures of twins who bear a striking resemblance to your dashing duo. They may be given different names in Mr Main's ur-text, but surely these are Istvan and Zoltan <em>avant le lettre</em>? I claim my five pounds.”</p>
