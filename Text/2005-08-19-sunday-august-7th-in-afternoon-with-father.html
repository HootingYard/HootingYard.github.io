  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Sunday, August 7th. In afternoon with Father H—— and John [Lord Dumfries] to Palace, and then with him to the Gruoch's Den. He gives us a long account of the psychical disturbances at B——; noises between his bed and the ceiling, like continuous explosion of petards, so that he could not hear himself speak, &amp;c. &amp;c. [Mr. Huggins afterwards recommended the use of a phonograph for these noises, in order to ascertain absolutely whether they are objective or subjective, and I wrote so to S——of B——.] Monday, August 8th. Father H——went away.” — A Goodrich-Freer (Miss X), <em>The Alleged Haunting Of B—— House</em></p>
