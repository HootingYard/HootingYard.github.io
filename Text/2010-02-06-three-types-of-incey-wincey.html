  <p>Incey-wincey badger, scrubbling in the dirt. Puts some sticks together and builds himself a yurt. He's a New Age badger, his name is Little Kurt. Careful now, his feelings are very easily hurt.</p>
  <p>Incey-wincey goat-boy, creature of two realms. We can see you darting in between the elms. Half of you is human, the other half's a goat. Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning in a moat.</p>
  <p>Incey-wincey lobster, clacking in the sea. His brain's completely alien to that of you and me. Incey-wincey lobster, much bigger than a bee. The lobster's very strange, and is never ever twee.</p>
