  <h1 id="post-10784">160 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)</h1>
  <p>And lo! a new year dawns, and bang on schedule reader Mike Jennings provides us with an update on the Dobson canon, listing all those pamphlets which have come to light and been mentioned in dispatches over the past year. As ever, Mr Jennings has applied the obscure yet somehow charming Blötzmann Numbering System for ease of reference. Unless otherwise stated, all pamphlets are out of print.</p>
  <p>Mr Jennings' previous listings can be found at these links: numbers <strong><a href="2010-01-15-104-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="104 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">1 to 104</a></strong>, <strong><a href="2011-01-14-128-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="128 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">105 to 128</a></strong>, <strong><a href="2011-12-29-139-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="139 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">129 to 139</a></strong>, and, all by itself, number <strong><a href="2010-01-15-104-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="140 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">140</a></strong>.</p>
