  <p>In <em>The Invention Of Murder&nbsp;: How The Victorians Revelled In Death And Detection And Created Modern Crime</em> (2011), Judith Flanders makes a passing reference which, though brief, has me eager to read the novel in question:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>In 1860, in <em>The Trail Of The Serpent</em>, Mrs Braddon had advanced her plot through Sloshy, the adopted child of a mute policeman</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Come to think of it, I may not bother to read the book itself, but simply adopt the characters for my own use. Sloshy! The mute policeman! They shall live again at Hooting Yard!</p>
