  <h1>The Life &amp; Times of Captain Cake</h1>
  <p>“All hands on deck!” cried Captain Cake. He looked so much like Lawrence Welk. His crew were grim. They played ping pong on the poop deck, with spite and hate. But Captain Cake, he hacked and choked, and took his buckets to shops on shore, where he saw Tallulah Bankhead. She was a card sharp in the dockyards.</p>
  <p>Now Captain Cake had gone to seed. He looked as if he had been cursed by some bright-fanged Aztec God. I think it might be called Abraxas—either that or Myrna Loy, whose face loomed huge when he shut his eyes. Wracked by palsy, his hands were withered, and all his timbers had been shivered.</p>
