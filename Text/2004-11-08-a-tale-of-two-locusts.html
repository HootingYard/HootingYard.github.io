  <h1>A Tale of Two Locusts</h1>

  <p>Do you remember that old Rolf Harris hit, <em>Two Little Boys</em>? Well, what took place with these two locusts was very similar to the story told in that song. What seems so unfair is that, because they were locusts, no one ever thought to grant them such musical immortality. It's a shame.</p>
