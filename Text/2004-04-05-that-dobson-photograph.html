  <h1>That “Dobson” Photograph</h1>
  <p>On Thursday 1st April we published an anonymously-sent photograph of a man and a child, one of whom was purportedly Dobson. I suggested this was probably an April Fool's Day prank. Now, reader Peter C Ross writes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sir&nbsp;: Having known Dobson for more years than I care to mention I am certain that the photograph you have received is of Dobson as a child and that the figure behind is his father (also known as Dobson). The identification is further confirmed by the corner of a Crittal window visible in the background. It is a well known fact that Dobson spent his formative years behind such a window.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is clearly nonsense. In his breathtaking—if indigestible—<em>List Of Every Single Person Dobson Met In His Life</em>, Jasper Poxhaven never mentions anyone named Ross, let alone Peter of that ilk, with or without a C. Our correspondent is either the shadowy figure who sent the photograph, or a maniac, or possibly both. There is a third possibility, but it is so terrifying in its implications that I will have to go and bathe my head in Dr Fleming's Brain Soothing Infusion &amp; Nerve Tonic (for external use only) before addressing it…</p>
