  <h1>Don't Say I Didn't Warn You</h1>
  <p>A few weeks ago, on 20th <a class="internal" href="2006-02-01-hooting-yard-archive-february-2006.html">February</a>, Hooting Yard provided full instructions for <em>Saving Your Swan</em> in the event of a bird flu pandemic. Clearly, the gritty northern folk who live in Cellardyke up in Scotland took absolutely no notice.</p>

  <p>I love the way the <em>Daily Mail</em> manages to inject a note of patriotic fervour. We don't care tuppence about all those foreign birds, it implies, but this was a <em>British</em> swan, dammit! I hope they sent a reporter to hand-deliver a message of condolence to our bereaved monarch (see <em>Frequently Asked Question</em>, yesterday).</p>
