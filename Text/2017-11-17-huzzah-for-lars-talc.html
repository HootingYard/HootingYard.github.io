  <p>What once was spineless has now acquired a spine. That old pamphlet <em>Obsequies For Lars Talc, Struck By Lightning</em> is newly available in an almost but not quite facsimile paperback edition. Only twenty-five copies of the original were printed—now every single one of you lot can buy as many copies as you like. Which I hope and pray you will. What with Christmas approaching, what better gift to give to those dearest to you, including that crumpled Jesuit hiding in the broom-cupboard?</p>
  <p>Go to <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/frank-key/obsequies-for-lars-talc-struck-by-lightning/paperback/product-23403653.html" class="external"><strong>Lulu</strong></a> to place your order(s) right this minute. It's the sensible thing to do.</p>
