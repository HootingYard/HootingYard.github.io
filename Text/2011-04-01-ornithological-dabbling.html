  <p>This week at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/04/an-ignorant-ornithologist/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I've devoted some words to the ever-intriguing subject of birds. Long-time readers will have read it before. I can always be relied on for avian lore. Some say I know not of what I speak, which is a monumental bit of cheek. Whether it's a pratincole, a lark, or a linnet, I know all there is to know about birds, innit? Oh for the wings, for the wings of a dove! Or the wings of a nuthatch if push comes to shove. When push comes to shove I usually fall over. Unlike the corncrake, the wren, or the plover. They just fly away, on wings of song. I think that's correct, but I may be wrong. There is so much to learn about birds of the air, more than my pea-sized brain can bear. But rather than stumbling through mental fog, I read words of wisdom in The Dabbler blog.</p>
