  <h1 id="post-6687">Am I So Poised?</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Do I know what my colours are?</p>
    <p>Do I make my vowels sing?</p>
    <p>Am I direct, sincere and simple?</p>
    <p>Do I know the proper way to sit in and rise from a chair?</p>
    <p>Am I lovable?</p>
    <p>Am I original?</p>
    <p>Am I valiant?</p>
    <p>Have I made a legal will?</p>
    <p>Do I know where it is?</p>
    <p>Do I hang up my clothes as soon as I take them off?</p>
    <p>Do I sew a snap-fastener on to each end of a piece of tape about an inch and a half long, and sew these tapes in the centre of all shoulder seams?</p>
    <p>Am I so poised, so on my centre, so innately joyous that life cannot sway me this way or that?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Jill Edwards' Self-Searcher, a series of questions for daily reflection, quoted in <em>Against The American Grain&nbsp;: Essays On The Effects Of Mass Culture</em> by Dwight Macdonald (1962).</p>
