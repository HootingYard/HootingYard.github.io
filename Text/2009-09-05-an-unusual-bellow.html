  <h1>An Unusual Bellow</h1>
  <p>Would that Alfred Hitchcock were with us now! It is time, surely, for a new version of <em>The Birds</em> called <em>The Cows</em>. First they attacked <strong><a href="2009-06-09-life-imitates-hooting-yard.html" class="internal" title="Life Imitates Hooting Yard">David Blunkett</a></strong>, which is understandable, but now they have killed a holidaying veterinary surgeon. Is there not authentic Hitchcockian menace in <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/sep/04/liz-crowsley-vet-death-cows" class="external">this report</a></strong>?</p>
  <p><em>around lunchtime they heard “an unusual bellow”</em></p>
  <p><em>“I looked out of the window and saw the lady in question stood up against the wall, she had a stick and was shaking it, trying to get the cows away.”</em></p>
  <p><em>Mrs Johnson said she could see the cows “all stood, huddled together in an arch”</em></p>
  <p><em>Crowsley's body was found leaning against a stone wall and a semi-circle of cows close by.</em></p>
