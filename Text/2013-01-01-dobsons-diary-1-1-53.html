  <h1 id="post-10740">Dobson's Diary 1.1.53</h1>
  <p><em>Dobson, the out of print pamphleteer, was an intermittent diarist. At certain periods in his life, he maintained a voluminous, almost demented daily journal. At other times he made only scattered and vestigial scribblings, and there are also whole stretches where he fell completely silent, at least as a diarist. Surprisingly, there has been as yet no attempt to marshal all the extant texts into a published edition. Here, however, is Dobson's diary entry written sixty years ago to the day, on the first of January 1953:</em></p>
  <p>Cabbage stalks in swans' blood for breakfast. Then I went for a trudge along the towpath of the filthy old canal. Stopped to gaze at cows—the cows gazed back. Spent untold hours slumped at my escritoire struggling with my pamphlet in progress, <em>Farming With Gnomes</em>. The problem is I know little about farming and even less about gnomes. Why, then, asked my inamorata Marigold Chew, did I choose the topic in the first place? She fails to grasp the intricate workings of what I have decided to dub “Dobson Praxis”, a praxis that itself may be the subject of a future pamphlet.</p>
  <p>When the time came to sharpen my pencil I could not find the pencil sharpener, so instead I picked up this week's copy of <em>The Listener</em> and read a fascinating article about a buff-breasted sandpiper. From a careful reading—and rereading—I deduced that this is some sort of bird, though what it is doing hanging around at a sewage works is beyond me. If I had wings and the power of flight I am by no means certain that I would choose to wallow in sewage when I could take wing and fly to, oh I don't know, somewhere less noisome and noxious.</p>
  <p>Actually, I note that the writer calls it a sewage farm rather than a sewage works. Perhaps this is a suitable type of farm for gnomes. I shall have to embark upon further research.</p>
  <p>Pig innards and peas for supper.</p>
