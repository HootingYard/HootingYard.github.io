  <h1>Spite</h1>
  <p>What is the best defence when your opponent tags the cicely courtneidges with baling? The received wisdom used to be that a shudder and mop could counter the threat, but this was blown apart during the Loopy Copse Tournament last month. Let's take a look at the position.</p>
  <div class="blockparagraphs">
  <p>Klinkbotz&nbsp;: <strong>4♠&nbsp;&nbsp;10♥&nbsp;&nbsp;7♥&nbsp;&nbsp;K♦</strong></p>
  <p>Blenkinsop&nbsp;: <strong>5♠&nbsp;&nbsp;5♥&nbsp;&nbsp;8♦&nbsp;&nbsp;Q♦</strong></p>
  <p>Toofle&nbsp;: <strong>2♣&nbsp;&nbsp;6♠&nbsp;&nbsp;9♠&nbsp;&nbsp;J♦</strong></p>
  <p>Blenkinsop clapped a jack hulbert with a pan before being rehoist by Klinkbotz's clever smothering manoeuvre. A shifty burlap by Toofle followed. Now, had I been Blenkinsop, I would have cut some slack by buffeting Toofle's tocker. Instead, she paid grist with a dubbin and held substandard thrum. Caking from Klinkbotz's hinge made a shard, a second tag, and an astounding half courtneidge with muck, leaving another gap.</p>
  <p>Problem&nbsp;: Toofle to play. Cambodge or writhing? And why?</p>
