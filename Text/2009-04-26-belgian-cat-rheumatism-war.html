  <p>“The inhabitants of Southwark considered a particular remedy, such as the use of cat skin as a remedy for rheumatism and chest complaints, as ‘traditional’ when it had in fact been newly introduced to the Borough of Southwark by Belgian refugees during the First World War.”</p>
  <p><em>Religious belief and popular culture in Southwark, c. 1880–1939</em> by S C Williams (OUP, 1999)</p>
