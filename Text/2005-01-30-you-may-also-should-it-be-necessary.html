  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“You may also, should it be necessary, not only twist your authorities, but actually falsify them, or quote something which you have invented entirely yourself. As a rule, your opponent has no books at hand, and could not use them if he had. The finest illustration of this is furnished by the French curé, who, to avoid being compelled, like other citizens, to pave the street in front of his house, quoted a saying which he described as biblical: <em>paveant illi, ego non pavebo</em>. That was quite enough for the municipal officers.” — Arthur Schopenhauer, <em>The Art Of Controversy</em></p>
