  <h1 id="post-247">When I'm 64</h1>
  <p>This morning I learned, a tad belatedly, that Hooting Yard has been voted 64th in a list of the <a href="http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2007/09/guide-to-blogging-2007-top-100-liberal.html" class="external">Top 100 Liberal Democrat blogs</a>. I confess to being utterly beflummoxed by this news, chiefly because I'm not a Liberal Democrat, have never voted Liberal Democrat, and doubt that I ever would vote Liberal Democrat. In the unlikely event that the “votes” cast in this poll were the result of human agency, as opposed to a fiendish electronic crunching exercise, then I applaud the good sense of those who voted. To reciprocate, here at Hooting Yard we did a quick straw poll to vote on our favourite Liberal Democrat. No prizes for guessing that the winner is, of course, Lembit Opik.</p>
  <p>One brief footnote: while we're on the subject of party politics, I am reliably informed that Michael Meacher keeps an A3 copy of the famous Hooting Yard Pontiff Mnemonic on his office wall.</p>
