  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“…then he was sent to Cambridge. From there he wrote to his mother, ‘I am penetrating into the inmost recesses of the Muses; climbing high Olympus, visiting the green pastures of Parnassus, and drinking deep from Pierian Springs'. This is terrible language for a child of fourteen. A boy who should talk like that now would be regarded with anxious concern by his loving parents. The present age is incredulous of the Infant Phenomenon. And no fond parent must for a moment imagine that by following the system laid out for the education of John Milton can a John Milton be produced.” — Elbert Hubbard, <em>Little Journeys To The Homes Of English Authors</em></p>
