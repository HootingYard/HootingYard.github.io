  <h1>The Language of Futbol</h1>
  <p>I said that I would not babble on about the World Cup, but that was merely a rash promise, easily broken. And how can I not mention the superb comment by Santiago Segurola in <em>El Pais</em> regarding England's opening performance against Paraguay?</p>
  <p>“It's hard to say what England were,” he wrote, “A flat team, grotesque and contaminating.”</p>
  <p>You can almost hear the chewy disgust in that exquisite choice of words (albeit in translation). Why can't the inarticulate has-beens slumped in their TV studio chairs talk like that?</p>
  <p>“What did you think of the first half, Brian?”</p>
  <p>“It was grotesque, it was contaminating, it filled my belly with disgust. Such a display of depravity have I ne'er seen in all my days in the dugout.”</p>
  <p>I have also been toying with the idea of noting down some of the more baffling comments from the commentary box, so watch this space…</p>
