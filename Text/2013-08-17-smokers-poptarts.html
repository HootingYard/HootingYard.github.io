  <h1 id="post-11856">Smokers' Poptarts!</h1>
  <p>My recent lassitude—which I think is now behind me—was occasioned in part by ResonanceFM's August break. I realise that having to babble into a microphone for half an hour every week is an effective spur to composition, and without that deadline I can happily gaze out of the window at crows and Not Get Anything Done.</p>
  <p>(Oh, by the way, throughout the month ResonanceFM is broadcasting old episodes of Hooting Yard <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/schedule" class="external">daily</a></strong> at 12.30 PM, so that should help to keep you lot from chewing your pillows in anguish.)</p>
  <p>Anyway, just as I was sloughing off my indolence and clambering back into my toboggan o' prose, I was further inspired by being asked to write a piece for another blog. Meeting someone else's deadline always concentrates the mind.</p>
  <p>So over at <strong><a href="http://blackberryjuniperandsherbet.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/bjs-solsl-hooting-yard-is-opening-post.html" class="external">BlackberryJuniper &amp; Sherbet</a></strong> you can read a brand new piece—written yesterday—together with a little introduction explaining why I was asked, and one reader's understanding of the Glory That Is Hooting Yard. Off you go!</p>
