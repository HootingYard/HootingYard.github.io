  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“I fancied a sepulchral voice exclaiming: ”Worship my toe at Ghent; my ribs at Florence; my skull at Bologna, Sienna, and Rome. Beware how you neglect this order; for my bones, as well as my spirit, have the miraculous property of being here, there, and everywhere,“ […] and hurrying into the open air, I was whirled away in the dark to Margate.</p>
  <p>William Beckford, <em>Dreams, Waking Thoughts &amp; Incidents; in a Series of Letters from Various Parts of Europe,</em> letter one, June 19th, 1780.</p>
