  <h1 id="post-15844">The Cuthbert Spraingue Song</h1>
  <p>Cuthbert Spraingue! Cuthbert Spraingue!<br />
  He's the boss of the Mayonnaise Gang!<br />
  His head's the same colour as his shoes.<br />
  He darts between elms &amp; bays &amp; yews.<br />
  He came unglued on St Bibblybibdib's Day.<br />
  A cart pulled up to take him away.<br />
  He fought them off with pins and straw,<br />
  Just pins and straw and nothing more.<br />
  They say he's related to Nobby Stiles,<br />
  According to the police station files,<br />
  But he denies any links by blood<br />
  To Nobby. memorably smeared with mud<br />
  At the end of that match in ’66.<br />
  Cuthbert Spraingue loathes Weetabix<br />
  And Coco-pops and Special K.<br />
  He eschews breakfast every day,<br />
  But his days still go with a bang!<br />
  For he's the boss of the Mayonnaise Gang!<br />
  Cuthbert Spraingue! Cuthbert Spraingue!</p>
