  <p>Since we met the Blot family on 29th August, there have been developments, as they say. Elkan Blot and Ultravox Blot, shown above, were apprehended a couple of days ago by Detective Captain Cargpan and his team of wistful coppers. Granting a rare interview to the <em>Weekly Thunderstorm</em>, the doughty detective said: “Me and my plods found this irksome pair mucking about in a very, very weird way with a piece of cardboard down at the docks. In fact, by consulting my notebook, I can confirm that they were mucking about with two pieces of cardboard. This sort of thing has got to be nipped in the bud, and I am the man to do the nipping.” When we find out to which remote, bleak and pestilential island the Blot pair will be transported for life, we shall of course let readers know.</p>
