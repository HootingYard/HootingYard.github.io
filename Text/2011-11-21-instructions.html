  <h1 id="post-7656">Instructions</h1>
  <p>I thought it prudent, when making preparations for last Friday's <strong><a href="http://www.woolfsonandtay.com/1/post/2011/11/frank-key-and-outa_spaceman-18-nov-2011.html" class="external">Evening Of Lugubrious Music &amp; Lopsided Prose</a></strong>, to provide the audience with a list of instructions, to ensure they conducted themselves properly. After all, one does not want to have to interrupt one's babbling to have to deal with fits of the vapours, noisy potato crisp munching, or other distractions. The printed programme for the evening thus included this list, which may be of use to other performers:</p>
  <p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MEMBERS OF THE AUDIENCE</strong></p>
  <p>I. Please remain seated during the more exciting moments.</p>
  <p>II. If for any reason you need to mop your brow, use a dainty napkin.</p>
  <p>III. Spillages must be paid for in coinage of the realm.</p>
  <p>IV. When the Darning-Needle of Destiny is unveiled, cower.</p>
  <p>V. Unseemly pangs may be tempered by moral balance.</p>
  <p>VI. Applause should be rendered with unbridled fanaticism.</p>
  <p>VII. Drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern, until I come and take you away (Isaiah, 36&nbsp;: 16,17)</p>
