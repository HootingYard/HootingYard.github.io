  <h1>Six Long Years Of Wittering ‘n’ Babble</h1>
  <p>Those of you familiar with the important Hooting Yard <strong><a href="2010-01-12-book-o-days.html" class="internal" title="Book O’ Days">Book o' Days</a></strong> will know that precisely six years ago today, the very first episode of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> was broadcast on <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/archives/3537" class="external">ResonanceFM</a></strong>. I will be celebrating by drinking a flask of aerated lettucewater and sacrificing a (vegan, marzipan) goat.</p>
  <p>Once upon a time, of course, radio shows were fugitive, ephemeral things, but today, with the wonders of podcasting, untold hours of Mr Key's babbling remain available for you to download from the ResonanceFM <strong><a href="http://podcasts.resonancefm.com/archives/category/shows/hooting" class="external">archive</a></strong>. Apparently, thousands of people do, certainly more than ever read this blog.</p>
  <p>This seems as good a time as any, then, to note that a new podcast maestro has taken over the reins, whose self-appointed task is to increase the frequency of releases. Past programmes have been issued as podcasts generally about once a fortnight, but the plan now is for them to appear twice a week, until the backlog is cleared.</p>
  <p>For an insight into the tremendous technical challenges of the process, I refer you to <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/feb06.htm#2006-02-25-1" class="hootingyard">this piece</a></strong> from the 2006 archives. Little has changed, save perhaps for the metal from which the maestro's hat has been welded.</p>
  <p>My thanks are due to the podcast maestro and his predecessors, and you can make their dedication to this noble cause worthwhile by <strong><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/hootingyard" class="external">subscribing</a></strong>, downloading, and listening, for so long and so often that Mr Key's voice haunts your dreams. And please remember that the very existence of ResonanceFM is a fragile and rickety thing, and your <strong><a href="http://resonancefm.com/support" class="external">donations</a></strong> to the station will help it to survive.</p>
