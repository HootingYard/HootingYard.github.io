  <p>At time of writing, Krishnan Guru-Murthy has nudged ahead of Yoko Ono in our poll to decide on the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard lapel accoutrement. Could it be, I wonder, that the email I fired off to him at Channel 4 News the other day bore fruit?</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Dear Mr Guru-Murthy</p>
    <p>You are currently in second place (behind Yoko Ono) in a readers' poll at Hooting Yard to choose the luminary most deserving of a complimentary Hooting Yard lapel accoutrement. Might I suggest you vote for yourself and encourage others in the Channel 4 newsroom to cast their votes in your favour?</p>
    <p>Clearly something is going right, as many of my readers may be under the impression you are a <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/?s=krishnan+guru-murthy" class="hootingyard">fictional character</a></strong>, and they still vote for you!</p>
    <p>Yours sincerely</p>
    <p>Frank Key</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Some readers may be appalled by what they see as a morally reprehensible attempt to influence the outcome of the poll. Let me assure these virtuous souls that I fully intend to fire off similar letters to De Botton, Huffington, Tempah, and Ono. But not Balls, for Christ's sake, not Balls!</p>
