  <h1 id="post-7943">The Bells!</h1>
  <p>I greatly admire those who devote time and energy to the study of extremely arcane, obscure, or specialised subjects. Such as <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2011/dec/23/robert-killick-kendrick-obituary" class="external">Robert Killick-Kendrick</a></strong>, whose obituary appears in today's <em>Grauniad</em>. Though he was “a man of many interests, which included guitar playing, choral singing, hiking and photographing the numerous butterflies that visited his garden”- and possibly sharing his wife's major preoccupation (she is “an expert on sand flies”)—our hero is particularly to be acclaimed for this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>He also made a study of domestic animals' bells, ranging from elephants in India to hunting dogs in southern France, which resulted in a scholarly, but sadly uncompleted book, illustrated mainly with his own photographs.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Incidentally, elsewhere in the <em>Grauniad</em> today, in the Weekend magazine, there is a photograph of what must surely be the most coveted Christmas gift of the year—of <em>any</em> year!—an Alain De Botton action figure. Curiously, there is no trace of the photo, nor indeed of the accompanying article, on the website.</p>
