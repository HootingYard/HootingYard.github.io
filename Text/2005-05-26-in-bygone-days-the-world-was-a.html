  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“In bygone days the world was a peaceful place, in which our forefathers knew not the blessings of Bile Beans … They were sound trenchermen, who called their few ailments ‘humours' or ‘vapours' and knew what peace of mind meant. Sixty years ago there was one lunatic in every six hundred people; to-day there is one in every two hundred.” — Isaac G Briggs, <em>Epilepsy, Hysteria And Neurasthenia</em></p>
