  <h1 id="post-12120">'Twas Brillig</h1>
  <div class="verse">
  <p>'Twas brillig, and I babbled guff<br />
  Until my listeners cried “Enough!”<br />
  And stopped my gob with a plug of dough<br />
  And then it was that I knew woe.</p>

  <p>A woe such as I'd never known<br />
  Not e'en when I was skin and bone<br />
  In starveling days of pimply youth<br />
  Before I grew so fat forsooth</p>

  <p>Fat and loud and babbling guff<br />
  All roister doister swagger and puff<br />
  Puffed up like one of those eerie toads<br />
  That leap at you from beside the roads</p>

  <p>Well, at least, they leap at <em>moi</em><br />
  I wrote of them in my memoir<br />
  The text of which is what I brayed<br />
  Hoping to make my listeners afraid</p>

  <p>Instead they plugged my gob with dough<br />
  And brought me down so very low<br />
  That now my life is full of woe<br />
  And it is time for me to go</p>

  <p>Go where? To the seaside I suppose<br />
  To my seaside chalet o' prose<br />
  To thump my typewriter's leaden keys<br />
  And write of hornets, wasps, and bees</p>
