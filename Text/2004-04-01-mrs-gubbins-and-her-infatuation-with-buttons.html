  <h1>Mrs Gubbins and Her Infatuation With Buttons</h1>
  <p>Our popular item <em>Mrs Gubbins Recommends</em> has been suspended while that dear old crone remains in police custody. Rather than leave readers bereft of exciting links to pursue, we asked her colleague Matilda Choctaw to ghost-write the column on a temporary basis. Here is her first contribution:</p>
  <p>“That Mrs Gubbins has a complete mania for buttons. Velcro, zips, and other fastening methods are completely foreign to her. That being the case, and ignoring the fact that she is facing serious criminal charges, I wish to honour her by pointing Hooting Yard readers in the direction of the <a class="external" href="http://www.buttonarium.com/">Buttonarium</a>. Now, where did I leave my crutches?”</p>
