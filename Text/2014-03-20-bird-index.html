  <p>Keen Hooting Yardist Ruthie Bosch drew to my attention the <em>Stith Thompson Motif Index of Folk Literature</em>, or more precisely the index to that Index. That was a week ago, and I am still trying to reorient my brain to take account of its existence. The world has changed for me, irrevocably. To give some idea of what I am babbling on about, you lot should listen, immediately, with lugholes alert, to <strong><a href="https://soundcloud.com/resonance-fm/18-00-00-hooting-yard-on-27" class="external">today's episode</a></strong> of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>, in which I took the opportunity to read (most of) the Stith Thompson Index index for <strong>Bird</strong>.</p>
