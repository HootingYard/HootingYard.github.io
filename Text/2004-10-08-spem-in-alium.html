  <h1>Spem in Alium</h1>
  <p>“<em>Spem in alium</em> is surely not just the greatest of all Thomas Tallis' musical achievements, but one of the great musical compositions of all time. Writing for forty independent voices, Thomas Tallis created a noble and imaginative masterpiece.” That's what one of the record companies selling a CD of the motet—chosen yesterday by Poppy Nisbet—has to say, and I don't disagree. It is quite sublime.</p>
  <p>In these leaden days when nobody knows Latin anymore, it is useful to provide a translation of the title. I was somewhat disconcerted by this email from Tim Thurn:</p>
  <p>“Spem in alium: <em>alium</em> is Latin for <em>onion</em>, so <em>Spem in</em> must mean <em>The world is just a great big</em>. Close listening reveals an astonishing affinity between Tallis' work and the Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell soul classic. For those who think <em>garlic</em> is a more accurate rendering of <em>alium</em>, and if we accept that <em>spem</em> translates as <em>hope</em>, then the motet is clearly an eleven minute incantation to ward off vampires. In the week of Michael Howard's Conservative Party conference, it is essential listening.”</p>
  <p>I suggest Tim buys himself a Latin dictionary. The full title of the work is <em>Spem in alium numquam habui</em>, which means <em>I have never put my hope in any other</em>. Tallis is referring not to Michael Howard, Marvin Gaye, nor Tammi Terrell, but to <em>Deus Israel qui irasceris et propitius eris et omnia peccata hominum in tribulatione dimittis</em>, the <em>God of Israel who will be angry and yet become again gracious and who forgives all the sins of suffering man</em>. Whether He, She or It will forgive Tim Thurn's sins is a moot point. I wouldn't.</p>
