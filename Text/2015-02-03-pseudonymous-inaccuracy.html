  <p>When James Newell Osterberg Jr was a tiny infant, he was fed on a diet of mashed up pap made from eggs. It was the piquant memory of these slops that informed his later decision, when embarking upon a career as a musical performer, to adopt the pseudonym Eggy Pap. A typographic error—or rather two typographic errors—rendered the name differently on the label of his first vinyl waxing. Deploying one of Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies <em>avant la lettre</em>, Osterberg determined to “honour [his] error as a hidden intention”, and retained the inaccurate pseudonym throughout his subsequent career.</p>
