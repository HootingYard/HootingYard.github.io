  <h1>My Unknown Boswell</h1>
  <p>Every now and then, I am buttonholed by importunate persons who yell, “Hey there, Frank Key, what kinds of things do you get up to when you're not researching and writing the Hooting Yard pages or doing your radio show on <a class="external" href="http://www.resonancefm.com">Resonance104.4FM</a>?”</p>
  <p>My tendency has been to deflect such questions with a grunt or a faked choking fit, or sometimes to burst into song. <em>Shenandoah</em> is one of my favourites, or I might attempt one of the <em>Four Last Songs</em> by Richard Strauss (1864-1949). Thus I allowed an air of mystery to surround me—or so I thought, until the other day, when reader Ian Sherred wrote to inform me that I am being followed by a biographer every bit as indefatigable as James Boswell.</p>
  <p>Apparently, a certain Jeb is frantically scribbling up my doings, without my permission. I don't know whether to be flattered or enraged. Reluctant as I am to allow Hooting Yard readers a glimpse into my hitherto secret life, I suppose I should point you in the direction of <a class="external" href="http://www.peterbrown.tv/lancervengeance2.html">Vengeance</a> by Jeb, given that it is already in the public domain.</p>
  <p>I have to say, though, that you might be better off taking a look at some of Mr Sherred's own stories, at <a class="external" href="http://www.constrained.org/authors/40/">www.constrained.org</a>.</p>
