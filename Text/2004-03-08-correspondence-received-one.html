  <h1>Correspondence Received&nbsp;: One</h1>
  <blockquote>
    <div class="blockparagraphs">
      <p>Sir&nbsp;: Idly browsing your website the other day (attracted, like so many others, by the mention of Xavier Cugat in your <a href="2003-01-01-the-hootingyard-search-engine-lure.html" class="internal">Search Engine Lure</a>), I was touched to see a reference to my current book in connection with your list of films such as <em>Apocalypse Cow</em> and <em>The Hound of Music</em>. May I also draw your attention to the following lesser-known highlights of the film-maker's art:</p>
      <p><em>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde Park</em> – the ill-fated follow up to <em>The Wild Bench</em>, in which a park attendant is pushed beyond the limits of endurance.</p>
      <p><em>I Spit on Your Gravy</em> – Fear and retribution behind the scenes at a top-class restaurant.</p>
      <p><em>Blackhead Jungle</em> – Acne-crazed youths on the rampage.</p>
      <p><em>On Her Majesty's Crown Derby Service</em> (aka <em>China Girl</em>) – Tense spy thriller in which James Bond foils a plot to steal a collection of priceless dinner plates from Buckingham Palace.</p>
      <p><em>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</em> – Sub-aqua football at its most thrilling.</p>
      <p><em>Dr Terror's House of Horace</em> – Unwary travellers are kidnapped and force-fed the works of the Roman poet Quintus Horatius Flaccus.</p>
      <p><em>When Dinah Shore Ruled The Earth</em> – Absolutely terrifying prehistoric jazz adventure.</p>
      <p>I beg to remain etc.,<br />
