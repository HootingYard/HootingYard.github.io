  <h1 id="post-11276">Tungsten Grebe</h1>
  <p>I noticed for sale in a shop window a tungsten grebe. It was a small model grebe fashioned out of tungsten, according to the hand-written tag attached to it by a piece of brown string. The price was illegible. The shop was shut. I passed on down the street.</p>
  <p>A week later, passing the same spot, I glanced at the window display and saw the tungsten grebe was gone. I was not emotionally devastated. I had wanted to find out the price, and depending upon what that was I might have bought the tungsten grebe, and put it on one of my windowsills. But I did not hanker for it. So again I passed on down the street.</p>
  <p>That was seventeen years ago. I cannot get that tungsten grebe out of my head. Its image seems etched on the inside of my eyelids. It is the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning, the last thing I think of with my head on the pillow as I drift off to sleep at night. In my dreams and daydreams I am standing at the shop window, gazing at the tungsten grebe, trying to decipher the price scribbled so inelegantly on the tag.</p>
  <p>Oh! Tungsten grebe, why do you haunt me so?</p>
  <p>That could be the first line of a song, could it not? It is a pity I have not a musical bone in my body. If I did, I could write the rest of the song, and give it a tune, and sing it, to the accompaniment of strummed banjo and mournful bassoon, and busk outside the site where the shop used to be, on that street I used to pass along, and then I might exorcise the phantom of that gorgeous, gorgeous tungsten grebe.</p>
