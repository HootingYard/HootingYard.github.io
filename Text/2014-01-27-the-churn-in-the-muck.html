  <p>Sag’ mir, wo die Blumen sind? I can scarcely credit that over a quarter of a century has passed since I wrote, illustrated, photocopied, folded, collated, stapled, signed and numbered fifty copies of <em>The Churn In The Muck</em>. Now, this spineless out of print pamphlet will set you back £93. That's how much a copy is selling for on <strong><a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/Frank-Key-The-Churn-in-the-Muck-limited-edition-50-copies-signed-by-author-/171222821324?pt=AU_Fiction_Books_2&amp;hash=item27ddace9cc" class="external">eBay</a></strong>.</p>

  <p>What do you get for your cash? “Vintage Frank Key surrealist writing, in a booklet that contains 4 pages of wallpaper sample and 4 pages of tracing paper. There is a murderous rivalry over an Icelandic fontoon buried at the bottom of a lake. Indefatigable Hungarian detective Bulent Hellbag arrives on the scene to solve the case”, according to Serendipity Bookstore in the far Antipodes. I should point out that, in addition to the wallpaper and tracing paper, there are actually pages of text, too. (I am not sure the blurb makes that quite clear.)</p>
