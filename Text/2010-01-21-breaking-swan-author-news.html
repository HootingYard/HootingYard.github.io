  <p>Reader Fitzmaurice Trenery has been studying very carefully number one in our series of <strong><em><a href="2010-01-16-notable-authors-sitting-on-swans-no-1-raymond-roussel.html" class="internal" title="Notable Authors Sitting On Swans, No. 1&nbsp;: Raymond Roussel">Notable Authors Sitting On Swans</a></em></strong>, and has reached a startling conclusion:</p>
  <p>“Mr Key&nbsp;: Contrary to the description of the photograph, it seems to me that it depicts the wondrous accidental meeting of two benighted creatures, the swan-headed child and the child-headed swan. See how they embrace, each chimera recognising in the other his own misery. The chin of the newly-confident child-headed swan seems to jut in new-found defiance of the world! I'm not sure if a beak can jut, so I shall reserve judgement on the swan-headed child—in any case it seems to me an altogether more ambiguous character. Such a firm grip on the child-headed swan's neck; I infer here the crafty sense in the swan-headed child's tiny bonce that it is the benefactor of this symbiotic relationship. After all, the swan-headed child may be dextrous and bipedal, but it is led around by a pea-sized brain. The child-headed swan, for its part, has a fey, ethereal beauty… but when the head matures into adulthood the neck will be powerless to support it, and what then? What then?”</p>
  <p>Though I would swear by the crumpled cloth of Anaxagrotax's winding-sheet that the snap does indeed show Raymond Roussel as a tiny, so forceful and convincing is Mr Trenery's argument that I am putting the series on hold pending further investigations. I have it in mind to employ for the purpose Agence Goron, the detective agency commissioned by Roussel to find and negotiate with an illustrator to provide the drawings for <em>New Impressions Of Africa</em> (1932).</p>
