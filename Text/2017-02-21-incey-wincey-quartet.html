  <p><em>Should you need to placate a squalling infant, here—reposted from several years ago—is a handy quartet of incey-winceys.</em></p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p>Incey-wincey badger, scrubbling in the dirt<br />
  Puts some sticks together and builds himself a yurt<br />
  He's a New Age badger, his name is Little Kurt<br />
  Careful now, his feelings are very easily hurt</p>
 
  <p>QIncey-wincey lobster, clacking in the sea<br />
  His brain's completely alien to that of you and me<br />
  Incey-wincey lobster, much bigger than a bee<br />
  The lobster's very strange, and is never ever twee</p>
 
  <p>Incey-wincey goat-boy, creature of two realms<br />
  We can see you darting in between the elms<br />
  Half of you is human, the other half's a goat<br />
  Incey-wincey goat-boy, drowning in a moat</p>
 
  <p>Incey-wincey Stalin with his pockmarked face<br />
  Keeps all his medals in a big briefcase<br />
  Lurks in the Kremlin hatching plots and schemes<br />
  Incey-wincey Stalin haunts your childhood dreams<br />
