  <p>This is Reginald Bosanquet (1932-1984), whose surname was appropriated by persons unknown as the title of Pansy Cradledew's favourite computer game. Older readers will remember Mr Bosanquet as a television newsreader and raffish drunk. According to his lamentably brief entry in the <a class="external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reginald_Bosanquet">wikipedia</a>, “viewers were sometimes not impressed by his competence at reading the news, he was often clearly puzzled by the correct pronunciation of foreign names, and by news stories containing technical matters he did not understand”. In other words, he had human frailties, rather than being a zonk-eyed robot. Those were the days. His father was a cricketer named Bernard Bosanquet who invented the googly, apparently. I have no idea what that means.</p>
