  <h1>Xylomancy</h1>
  <p>Xylomancy is the art of divination using twigs. A list of the various -omancys would no doubt be diverting, but you can look it up elsewhere. One tool of divination usually absent from the reference books, however, is Clancyomancy, the technique of predicting the future using fat paperbacks by Tom Clancy purchased from airport bookstalls. Please note that success in this art takes years of training, and should not be attempted by the ingénue.</p>
