  <p>Over in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/04/parallel-worlds/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week, I am thrilled by the announcement of “Islamic Google Earth”, and wonder what other parallel worlds may be brought into existence. What I do not mention in the piece is Hooting Yard Earth, an important new interweb-based initiative over which boffins are currently slaving in their remote subterranean Alpine fastness. Details are sketchy, but apparently they think they have nearly completed work on an app which will tell you how to get from Sawdust Bridge to the Blister Lane Bypass without becoming hopelessly entangled in one of those terrible thickets of poisonous nettles.</p>
