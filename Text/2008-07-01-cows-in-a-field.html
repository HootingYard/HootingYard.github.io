  <p>An exciting letter arrives from OutaSpaceman:</p>
  <p><em>I don't know why but, while researching <strong><a href="http://www.britishseagull.co.uk/history.php" class="external">British Seagull outboard motors</a></strong>, I thought of Hooting Yard. Then, yesterday, when I was out on my velocipede (which is named <strong><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/outa_spaceman/2603580829/" class="external">Potato</a></strong>), I passed a field of cows, and stopped to have a chat with them. As I declaimed, at length, on my conviction that they should rise up and cast off their collective yokes of oppression, I failed to notice a family group walking along the path behind me. They began to move much more quickly in the opposite direction.</em></p>
  <p>Clearly the family had not read Dobson's pamphlet <em>How To Conduct Yourself When Encountering A Cyclist Speaking With Cows In A Field</em> (out of print).</p>
  <p>OutaSpaceman enclosed a delightful photograph of the cows he met:</p>
