  <h1>A Brief Note About Pills</h1>
  <p>Please do not confuse toad-pills—those “tiny pink miracles of batrachian well-being” as Dobson called them in his engaging pamphlet <em>How I Counted All The Toads In Scandinavi</em> (out of print)—with other sorts of pills, not least those of Lockyer, whose tomb in Southwark Cathedral commemorates his genius:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <div class="verse">
      <p>Here Lockyer lies interr'd, enough&nbsp;: his name<br />
      Speaks one hath few competitors in fame ;<br />
      A Name soe Great soe Generall'e may scorne<br />
      Inscriptions wh doe vulgar tombs adorne&nbsp;:<br />
      A diminution to write in verse<br />
      His eulogies wh most men's mouths rehearse.<br />
      His virtues and his PILLS are so well known,<br />
      That envy can't confine them under stone.<br />
      But they'll survive his dust and not expire<br />
      Till all things else at th'universall fire.<br />
      This verse is lost, his PILL Embalmes him safe<br />
      To future times without an Epitaph&nbsp;:</p>
      <p>Repair'd Octobr 1741<br />
      Deceast Aprill ye 26th Anno Do&nbsp;: 1672 Aged 72</p>
