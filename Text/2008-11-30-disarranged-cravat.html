  <h1 id="post-1038">Disarranged Cravat</h1>
  <p>A dandy was the&nbsp;Black Prince of Elegance, the demigod of boredom who looked at the world with an eye as glassy as his pince-nez, suffering because his disarranged cravat had a crease, like the ancient Sybarite who suffered because his rose was crushed. He is indifferent about the horse he rides, the woman he greets, and the man he encounters and at whom he gazes a while before recognizing him. He bears, written on his forehead—in English—this insolent inscription: What do you and I have in common?&nbsp;– <em>Paul de Saint-Victor, 1859</em></p>
