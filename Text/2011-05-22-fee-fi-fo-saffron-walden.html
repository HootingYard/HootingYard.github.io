  <h1>Fee Fi Fo Saffron Walden</h1>
  <p>Recently I posted a <strong><a href="2011-04-02-fee-fi-fo-fum.html" class="internal" title="Fee Fi Fo Fum">piece</a></strong> about a giant who roars “Fee Fi Fo Fum!” and smells the blood of an Englishman, and a couple of years ago I became enthusiastic about Thomas Nashe (1567-c.1601) among whose works is the splendidly titled <em><strong><a href="2009-08-04-have-with-you-to-saffron-walden.html" class="internal" title="Have With You To Saffron Walden">Have With You To Saffron Walden</a></strong></em>—which, alas, I never got round to reading. Had I done so, I would already have learned what I found out today.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Father had taken us to see John Gielgud in the title role [of <em>King Lear</em>] at Stratford-upon-Avon, and although Gielgud was marvellous, it was the words of Poor Tom, the Bedlam beggar on the stormy heath (actually Edgar, in disguise), that still rang in my ears:</p>
    <p><em>Child Rowland to the dark tower came;</em></p>
    <p><em>His word was still</em></p>
    <p><em>Fie, foh, and fum!</em></p>
    <p><em>I smell the blood of a British man!</em></p>
    <p>“Did Shakespeare steal that from <em>Jack and the Beanstalk</em>?” I had whispered in Daffy's ear. Or had the fairytale borrowed the words from Shakespeare? “Neither,” she whispered back: both had cribbed them from Thomas Nashe's <em>Have With You To Saffron Walden</em>, which, having been staged in 1596, pre-dated them.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>This is from <em>The Weed That Strings The Hangman's Bag</em> by Alan Bradley (2010), the second of his Flavia de Luce mysteries. These are new to me, but I am pleased to tell you that the heroine is an eleven-year-old amateur chemist and sleuth—a plucky and resourceful tot who bears a striking resemblance to our very own Tiny Enid, without the fascism and the club foot. It is a hugely enjoyable read, as one might expect from a book which makes mention of “a pair of gutta-percha motoring galoshes (‘Ideal for Country Breakdowns')”.</p>
