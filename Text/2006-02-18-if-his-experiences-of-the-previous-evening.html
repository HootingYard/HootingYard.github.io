  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“If his experiences of the previous evening had been distressing, the breakfast which was set before him was positively heart-rending. A muddy-looking liquid which they called coffee, soggy biscuits, a beefsteak that would rival in toughness a piece of baked gutta percha, and evidently swimming in lard, and potatoes which gave decided tokens of having been served on more than one previous occasion. With a smothered groan he attacked the unsavoury viands, and by dint of great effort managed to appease his hunger, to the serious derangement of his digestive organs.” — Allan Pinkerton, <em>The Burglar's Fate And The Detectives</em></p>
