  <h1>State Of The Nation</h1>
  <p>Well, not the state of the nation, really, but the state of that godforsaken blot that is Mr Key's mental bailiwick. This weekend I have mostly been poking about in the flues of <strong><em><a href="2014-02-11-exciting-book-news.html" class="internal" title="Exciting Book News">Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</a></em></strong>, doing a final bit of dusting before I tie the manuscript to the leg of a postal pigeon and wave it away, into the blue beyond, to be deposited on the desk of my editor at Constable. With the book done, at last, I shall be able to return to full-time active service duty at Hooting Yard. Watch this space.</p>
