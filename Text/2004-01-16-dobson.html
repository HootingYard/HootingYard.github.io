  <h1>Dobson</h1>
  <p>Dobson the pamphleteer, that is, rather than Dobson the playwright (see 22nd December and 1st January). Plans have been announced for a new series of “self-help” titles, which Dobson has apparently been working on with some gusto. They include: <em>Teach Yourself Petulance</em>; <em>Mucking About For Fun &amp; Profit</em>; <em>Idiot's Guide To Moral Turpitude</em>; <em>Fecklessness Made Simple</em>; <em>Learn To Doze In Just 24 Hours!</em>; <em>How To Be In A Bad Mood; Lassitude The Easy Way; Making A Fool of Yourself for Dummies</em>; <em>Idiot's Guide To Social Gaffes</em>; <em>Bluff Your Way to Pomposity</em>; <em>Five Simple Steps To Lying Around Aimlessly</em>; <em>Tomfoolery Made Simple</em>; <em>Teach Yourself Frowning</em>; <em>Make Your Own Faux Pas;</em> and <em>The Seven Habits of Craven &amp; Wretched People</em>.</p>
