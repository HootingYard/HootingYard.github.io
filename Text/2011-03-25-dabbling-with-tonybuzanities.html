  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2011/03/my-favourite-pedagogue/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> this week I recall my favourite pedagogue, a chap with a jarring speech impediment. A slightly different version of the piece appeared here some years ago. One detail that I certainly had no intention of changing, for obvious reasons, was the pedagogue's use, for pedagogic purposes, of tonybuzanities. These awe-inspiring pedagogic aids are named after Tony Buzan, he of the sepulchral voice and the flowing black cape—truly a boulevard magnifico, if ever there was one, and a magnifico whose brain pulsates at a rate lesser mortals can only dream about, while dribbling and grovelling at his feet.</p>
