  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The learning … of the censors and critics was often indeed remarkable. They condemned a recondite treatise on Trigonometry, because they imagined it contained heretical opinions concerning the doctrine of the Trinity; and another work which was devoted to the study of Insects was prohibited, because they concluded that it was a secret attack upon the Jesuits.”</p>
  <p>P. H. Ditchfield, <em>Books Fatal to their Authors</em></p>
