  <h1 id="post-12646">So What?</h1>
  <p>Roger Lewis, in his <em>Spectator</em> review of a new biography of Charlie Chaplin by Peter Ackroyd, notes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Chaplin died on Christmas Day 1977. Ackroyd doesn't mention this, but the comedian's coffin was stolen by grave robbers, who phoned Paulette Goddard, one of his wives and the co-star of <em>The Gold Rush</em>, hoping they could make a ransom demand. “We've got Chaplin,” they announced. “So what?” she said, slamming down the phone.</p>
  </blockquote>
