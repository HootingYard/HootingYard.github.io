  <p>A note arrives from my son Ed.</p>
  <p><em>Hey Pa,</em> he writes, <em>Did you realise that</em> Not Hairy God <em>is an anagram of</em> Hooting Yard? <em>I liked that, and I think you will too.</em></p>
  <p>And I do. I just wonder why I had not already been informed of this by R., the sort of anagrammatist-by-appointment to Hooting Yard. Those of you who keep a beady eye on the comments here will be familiar with R.'s stupendous work. Though R. remains resistant to being anagrammatised himself, for obvious reasons.</p>
