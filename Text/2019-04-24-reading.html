  <h1 id="post-16844">Reading</h1>
  <p>One consequence of my hopeless eyesight is that, over the past couple of years, reading has become somewhat difficult. Even armed with industrial-strength magnifying spectacles, issued by my eye doctors, it is a strain to read standard size type.</p>
  <p>I have always loved books as physical objects, and eschewed their digital, electronic counterparts. But having been given a Kindle Fire tablet as a birthday gift, I have become—of necessity—a convert to the e-book. I can read again, voraciously, without having to peer like a little mole.</p>
  <p>Thus, in the last few months, I've been splurging, my reading life as demented and enthusiastic as ever it was. I've reread Beckett (<em>Molloy</em>) and Kafka (<em>Americ</em>a), Henry Fielding and Mickey Spillane, read Theodore Dalrymple's marvellous book on litter (<em>Litter&nbsp;: The Remains Of Our Culture</em>), Melanie Phillips' memoir <em>Guardian Angel</em>, Francis Iles, Derek Raymond, and James Hadley Chase, H P Lovecaft, William Hazlitt, and Sir Thomas Browne, and am currently bingeing on Georges Simenon. What a wonder he is.</p>
