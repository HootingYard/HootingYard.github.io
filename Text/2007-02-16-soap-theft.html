  <h1 id="post-54">Soap Theft</h1>
  <p>More from Carl Sagan's excellent <em><strong>The Demon-Haunted World</strong></em>. He tells us that, according to alien abductee Betty Hill, the pesky visitors from outer space “frequently help themselves to some of [the abductee's] belongings, such as fishing rods, jewelry of different types, eyeglasses or a cup of laundry soap”.</p>
  <p>Remember that, and next time you see a myopic angler festooned with rings and necklaces emerging from the launderette, you can make a citizen's arrest and cart it off to your secret underground lab.</p>
