  <p>“On Thursday morning, he awoke heavy, confused and splenetic. On Friday, he remembered a friend's prescription that, on arising, he should cut two or three brisk capers round the room, which he did and found attended with most agreeable effects. It expelled the phlegm from his heart, gave his blood a free circulation and his spirits a brisk flow, so that he was all at once made happy. He resolved to persist in the exercise.”</p>
  <p>The James Boswell approach to getting up in the morning, as noted by Rayner Heppenstall in <em>Reflections On The Newgate Calendar</em> (1975).</p>
