  <h1 id="post-8187">The Big Questions</h1>
  <p>Rummaging around on the BBC iPlayer, I discovered a programme new to me, a studio discussion show called <em>The Big Questions</em>. Well, I'm not sure about the size of the questions, but some of the answers made me laugh.</p>
  <p>Asked to name a single coherent objective of the Occupy movement, one of the guests replied “We're against all the injustice in the world”. He sounded like a plaintive seven-year-old whining that life isn't fair. Perhaps I'm being too harsh. For some unexplained reason he was wearing one of those silly masks, so for all I know perhaps he <em>was</em> an upset seven-year-old.</p>
  <p>A bit later on a woman who appeared to be something to do with the Church of England opined that the government should be responsible for origami.</p>
  <p>I think this show may be unmissable.</p>
