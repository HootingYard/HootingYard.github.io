  <p>This week in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2014/08/acronym-acrostic/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong> I revisit my explanation of the true meaning of the words ACRONYM and ACROSTIC. There has been a very slight bit of rewriting, the sort of thing that, in years to come, when I am long dead and gone, may keep scholars occupied, or indeed fighting with one another, as they fret and worry and chew their pencils over the difference between the original and the revised versions. To lay a trap for those future scholars, let me just note here that the Dabbler text includes the word <em>filthy</em>, which is absent from the original Hooting Yard text. This might be connected to the recent appearance on these pages of the <a href="2014-08-12-filthy-magpie.html" class="internal" title="Filthy Magpie"><strong>filthy magpie</strong></a>. Or it might not. Of such arcana, pamphlets can be written—and will be!—by scribblers with nothing better to do.</p>
