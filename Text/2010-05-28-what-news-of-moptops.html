  <p>It has long been my conviction that newspapers in this age o' pap ‘n’ barbarism are written and edited by numbskulls, dimwits, airheads and know-noughts. The sort of people who think “prima donna” is spelled, and means, “pre-Madonna” and who are indeed wholly ignorant of almost everything that happened before about 1985.</p>
  <p>Here is a picture of Ringo Starr. I need not explain to Hooting Yard readers who he is.</p>

  <p>Ringo was visiting the Chelsea Flower Show this week. A snap appeared in the <em><strong><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/chelseaflowershow/7763424/Chelsea-Flower-Show-2010-celebrities-at-Chelsea.html?image=1" class="external">Telegraph</a></strong></em>. The caption? “Ringo Starr, <em>the narrator of Thomas the Tank Engine</em>, with his wife Barbara Bach at the Chelsea Flower Show 2010.” [My italics.]</p>
  <p>Cruel it may be, but one is tempted to force these nitwits to listen to “Octopus's Garden” over and over and over again, until the cows come home.</p>
