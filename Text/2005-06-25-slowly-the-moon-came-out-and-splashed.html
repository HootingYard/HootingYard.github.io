  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Slowly the moon came out and splashed its evil coldness over the desert, and slowly Halloran twisted his body around and stared with burning, widened eyes at them… They were walking towards him with maddening deliberation, the most evil, the most unholy-looking, hideously repulsive group he had ever seen. The two might have been cowboys, except for their faces. They were dressed in regular range gear; ropes, belted guns, loudly checked shirts and handkerchiefs, stitched boots, faded blue jeans—their heavy, batwing chaps flapping in the night like wings of grisly birds of evil. But the faces under the tall sombreros! … they were the faces of ghoulish beasts with snapping black eyes, huge canine nostrils, coarsely matted hair. Halloran stared and his tongue was hot and thick when he tried to move it. The word <em>werewolves</em> seemed to tumble over and over in his numbed mind.” — Eric Lennox, <em>Lair Of The Damned</em></p>
