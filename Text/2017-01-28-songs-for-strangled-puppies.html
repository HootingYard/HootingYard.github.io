  <p><em>Songs For Strangled Puppies</em> is a new album of sentimental ballads by tear-stained balladeer Biff Chomsky, a follow-up to his smash hit bestseller <em>Songs For Drowned Kittens</em>.</p>
  <p>“I am particularly proud of this new waxing” said Biff in an interview with top dead-puppy-and-kitten magazine <em>The Daily Small Slaughtered Animals Digest</em>, “Because the body count is slightly higher than on my previous album. That had only one or two kittens drowned per song, whereas on the new one, I sing several schmaltzy ballads in which upwards of a dozen puppies have the life squeezed out of them, in one case by the lumbering walrus-moustached serial killer Babinsky, turning his attention for once to the canine world.”</p>
  <p>This is not the first time Babinsky has been celebrated in song, though earlier numbers have eschewed the tear-stained ballad approach. More often they have been hideous screechings and howlings composed by bearded grumpy avant garde German nitwits such as Horst Gack and Horst Gack's familiar, a weird homunculus which perches on his shoulder and hisses at passers-by.</p>
  <p>“I was hoping to get Horst Gack's homunculus to join me on a duet,” said Biff Chomsky, “But when I approached him, he bit me. I immediately had a tetanus jab, but it didn't do much good. Ever since I have had a fever and an ague and fits and convulsions and to be honest I'm not sure when I'll be able to get back in the studio to record my next album, <em>Songs For Garrotted Baby Koala Bears</em>.”</p>
  <p>Each copy of the new album comes with a free tin pail in which weeping listeners can collect their tears.</p>
