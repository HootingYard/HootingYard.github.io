  <h1>Thoughts On Presenting <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> For Years &amp; Years</h1>
  
  <div class="verse">
    <p>'Twas brillig, and I babbled guff<br/>
    Until my listeners cried “Enough!”<br/>
    And stopped my gob with a plug of dough<br/>
    And then it was that I knew woe.</p>

    <p>A woe such as I'd never known<br/>
    Not e'en when I was skin and bone<br/>
    In starveling days of pimply youth<br/>
    Before I grew so fat forsooth.</p>

    <p>Fat and loud and babbling guff,<br/>
    All roister doister swagger and puff,<br/>
    Puffed up like one of those eerie toads<br/>
    That leap at you from beside the roads.</p>

    <p>Well, at least, they leap at moi.<br/>
    I wrote of them in my memoir,<br/>
    The text of which is what I brayed<br/>
    Hoping to make my listeners afraid.</p>

    <p>Instead they plugged my gob with dough<br/>
    And brought me down so very low<br/>
    That now my life is full of woe<br/>
    And it is time for me to go.</p>

    <p>Go where? To the seaside I suppose<br/>
    To my seaside chalet o' prose<br/>
    To thump my typewriter's leaden keys<br/>
    And write of hornets, wasps, and bees.</p>
