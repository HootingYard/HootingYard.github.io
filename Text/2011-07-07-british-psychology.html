  <h1>British Psychology</h1>
  <p>Following on from the potted sketches of our national character by <strong><a href="2010-09-01-77-words.html" class="internal" title="77 Words">Brit</a></strong> and <strong><a href="2011-07-06-history-lesson.html" class="internal" title="History Lesson">Wartime Housewife</a></strong>, let us turn to Norman Davies. It is far too long since I have posted extracts from his magnificent pamphlet <em>Further Science&nbsp;: Book 20</em> (2001), which I introduced to readers way back in <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/jan04.htm#2004-01-20-3" class="hootingyard">January 2004</a></strong>, and quoted further in <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/feb04.htm#2004-02-20-3" class="hootingyard">February 2004</a></strong> and <strong><a href="http://www.hootingyard.org/archive/jul05.htm#2005-07-21-1" class="hootingyard">July 2005</a></strong>. Here then, exactly as it appears in the pamphlet, is Davies on “British Psychology”:</p>
