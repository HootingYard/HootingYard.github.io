  <h1 id="post-329">Bees!</h1>
  <p>What was that I was saying about turning Hooting Yard into a <strong><a href="2007-12-31-onwards-and-upwards.html" class="internal" title="Onwards And Upwards!">daily blog</a></strong>? Two days into the new year and I fear my plans are scuppered. I am just not going to have time, am I? I am going to be far too busy watching bees!</p>
  <p>The ever-reliable <a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2008/01/cold-mainly-dry-tonight.html" class="external"><strong>Mustard Plaster</strong></a> alerts us to the Natural History Museum's live <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/kids-only/naturecams/beecam/index.html" class="external"><strong>beecam</strong></a>—or possibly <a href="http://www.nhm.ac.uk/kids-only/naturecams/beecam/index.html" class="external"><strong>beecast</strong></a>, they haven't quite made up their minds what to call it. Either way, I know what I am going to be doing with my every waking hour for the foreseeable future.</p>
