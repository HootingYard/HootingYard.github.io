  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Man is formed from a species of mussel. If made of the hard mussel he lives long—it is difficult for him to die. But if he happens to be made of the poisonous mussel, he is fragile, easily upset, and does not live long. The soul of man is called his anganga, or that which goes or comes. It is said to be the daughter of Taufanuu, or vapour of lands, which forms clouds, and as the dark cloudy covering of night comes on, man feels sleepy, because his soul wishes to go and visit its mother.” — George Turner, <em>Samoa, A Hundred Years Ago And Long Before</em></p>
