  <h1>The Portrait Of A Tortoise</h1>
  <p>Cast your mind back to the sixteenth of January. That was the day I posted an item, under the heading <a href="2008-01-16-mrs-snookes-tortoise.html" class="internal" title="Mrs Snooke's Tortoise"><strong><em>Mrs Snooke's Tortoise</em></strong></a>, about Sylvia Townsend Warner's 1946 book <em>The Portrait Of A Tortoise</em>, where she extracted from the <em>Journals</em> of the 18<sup>th</sup> century clergyman Gilbert White all the entries regarding his tortoise, Timothy. I suggested at the time that a reading of this would make a splendid special edition of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>, and lo! it has come to pass. I recorded it this morning, and it will be broadcast on ResonanceFM over the Christmas/New Year fortnight. I am not yet sure of the date, but keep an eye on the <a href="http://resonancefm.com/schedule" class="external"><strong>schedule</strong></a> and be sure not to miss it.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> The programme will be broadcast at 12.20 PM on Boxing Day, December 26th.</p>
