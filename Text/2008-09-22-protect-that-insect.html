  <p>According to today's <em>Guardian</em>, back in 1964 an Israeli newspaper reported that the music of the Beatles included <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/22/israelandthepalestinians.thebeatles" class="external">“yeah-yeah-yeah howls which are capable of striking dead a real beetle”</a></strong>. I am sure Yoko takes a very dim view of gratuitous cruelty to insects, and I look forward to the full-page advertisements she will surely be taking out in the world's major newspapers to express her, and her bespectacled husband's, devotion to our creepy-crawly friends.</p>
