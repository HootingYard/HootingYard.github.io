  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Theodora and Amaryllis liv'd together some Time, and at last by the constant perusal of airy Books, and a few entertaining Companions, they had in some measure forgot their unfortunate Lovers, but they resolv'd never for the future to fix their Affections upon any Man living; and living in Luxury, in the prime of their Years, in a hot inciting Climate, they at length were naturally inclin'd to the most abominable Pollution” — Giles Jacob, <em>Tractus De Hermaphrodites</em></p>
