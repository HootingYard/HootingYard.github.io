  <h1>Bile Möp Kit</h1>
  <p>As I write, the result of the general election has been confirmed as a hung parliament, and it is not yet clear who will form the government. While pundits babble, let us take pause, and note that 6 May 2010 will go down in history, or at least in the Hooting Yard <strong><a href="2010-01-12-book-o-days.html" class="internal" title="Book O’ Days">Book o' Days</a></strong> (which amounts to the same thing) as the day <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lembit_%C3%96pik" class="external">Lembit Öpik</a></strong> lost his seat. Note that umlaut!</p>
  <p>But as we hang our heads, and weep, remember that every cloud has a silver lining. Mr Öpik is now free to concentrate on other things, and I fully expect him to pursue a glittering media career. In a few weeks time, we will be unable to turn on a television or radio or i-hub without seeing the Estonian Anagram (bile möp kit?) presenting, for example, “The Lembit Öpik Meteorite Collision Show, With Russian Bimbos!”</p>
