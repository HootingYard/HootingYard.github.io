  <h1 id="post-5274">I</h1>
  <p>This morning I embarked upon the latest, and I hope final, proofreadnig of the forthcoming Hooting Yard paperback anthology. As I read, a Great Imponderable occurred to me, and as it happens the ‘I’ in our alphabetic schedule stands for Imponderable.</p>
  <p>Why is it, I wonder, that so many of my stories are set in the countryside, and feature peasants and farmyards and rustic squalor, given that I grew up on a suburban council estate and have lived my entire life, apart from about two months in 1980, in what Keith Pratt in <em>Nuts In May</em> calls “the hurly-burly of the urban conurbation”?</p>
