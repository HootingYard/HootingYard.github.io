  <h1 id="post-15341">Eye Jab Day</h1>
  <p>This afternoon I shall be undergoing what seems like the umpteenth <em>injection of a needle directly into my eyeball</em>. It occurs to me that at some point I ought to write an account of what goes on at Tuesday Injection Club, introducing you lot to some of the characters I encounter, the doctors, nurses, and ancillary staff and the other patients. I can also attempt to answer some of the burning questions that are raised, such as <em>why do I never get offered a cup of tea?</em> and <em>who is that mad woman who marches to and fro brandishing a clipboard but never actually speaks to anyone?</em></p>
  <p>I shall be interested to discover if, this week, I experience the Black Spot. Sometimes, after an injection, I have a Black Spot in my eye for a day or two, and sometimes not. The first time this happened it was mightily disconcerting. Now I treat it with airy familiarity, and imagine it as something that might have inspired a tale by J Sheridan Le Fanu.</p>
  <p>My more devoted readers will no doubt be asking <em>but Mr Key can you actually see any better?</em> to which the answer is, <em>no, not yet, I am still perceiving the world through a blur of hazy mist or a haze of misty blur</em>.</p>
  <p>Onwards to jab time!</p>
