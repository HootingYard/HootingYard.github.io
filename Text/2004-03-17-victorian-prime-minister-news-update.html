  <h1>Victorian Prime Minister News Update</h1>
  <p>When he wasn't rescuing fallen women or devising theories about Ancient Grecian colour blindness (see 2nd March), William Ewart Gladstone enthused about Atlantis. He was so infatuated with Ignatius Donnelly's book <em>Atlantis, The Antediluvian World</em> (1882) that he begged the Treasury for funds to mount an expedition of discovery, having decided that the Azores were the mountain peaks of the lost continent. The cabinet refused to let him have any money for this harebrained scheme, displaying a level of judiciousness which would not go amiss today.</p>
