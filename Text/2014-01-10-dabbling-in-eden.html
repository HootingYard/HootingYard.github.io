  <p>The monopod flautist Ian Anderson once sang about the time “when the Eve-bitten apple returned to destroy the tree”. I have no idea what he was going on about, and I suspect Mr Anderson may just have wanted something to rhyme with the “sea” and “to be” endings of the preceding lines in his song.</p>
  <p>In any case, it is the time <em>before</em> the apple returned to the Garden of Eden that concerns me today, over in my cupboard at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2014/01/replica-eden/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, the editor of which found this splendidly apt picture with which to illustrate the piece.</p>
