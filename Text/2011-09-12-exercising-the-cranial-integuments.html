  <blockquote>
    <p>If a thing is made of chocolate, comes from Switzerland, and is shaped like unto a roll, could it reasonably be anything other than a chocolate swiss roll?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>So asks Atahualpa Tompkins in his runaway bestseller <em>Mind-Bending Brain-Teasers For The Cranial Integuments</em>, a collection of hundreds of equally diverting thought experiments. It's a fat book, as fat as the Bible, but not black like the Bible. In fact its cover comes in a variety of hues, shades of Tompkins' own devising, created from pigments unutterable.</p>
  <p>Another of his food-and-drink-based quizzums is:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If it looks like an egg, and has its own nog, why is it not an egg nog?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>The best way to read this book is one question at a time. I found, in foolishly trying to read a whole page-worth of queries at one sitting, that my brain overheated and vapours hissed out of my ears and I had to go and lie flat on my back in a pitch black room, pitch black like the Bible, for umpteen hours. “Umpteen”, incidentally, is a number that crops up umpteen times in the book, for example in this brain-teaser:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>If a he-man tosses umpteen medicine balls into a waiting bin, how big must the bin be to gather unto itself all those umpteen medicine balls tossed into it by the he-man?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>You can see what I mean about the overheating and the vapours and the lying flat on one's back and the pitch black and the Bible.</p>
