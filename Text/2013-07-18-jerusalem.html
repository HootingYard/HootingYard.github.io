  <p>And did those feet? Well, did they? I don't give two pins about the time, whether it was in ancient time or modern time or some other time, I just want to know if those feet did, and if they did, what it was, exactly, that they did. I suppose you will tell me that they walked. Lawks-a-mercy!, I'd never have guessed. Those feet walked, did they? Take me to the foot of our stairs! And don't get me started on that holy lamb of God. If I catch sight of it I'll have it sheared and its fleece spun and knitted into a pair of woolly socks before you can say Jack Spraggins. And I will put those socks on my feet and I will walk, yes, I will walk upon England's mountains green. Just try to stop me, buster.</p>
