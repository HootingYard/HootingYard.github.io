  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“When I was desirous to delight my mind (<em>animus</em>) according to my idea of heavenly blessedness, a sudden stupor, occasioned by the light of heaven, which is as white as snow, and whose essence is said to be wisdom, seized my mind (<em>mens</em>) and darkness my eyes, and I was reduced to a state of insanity: and presently, from the heat of heaven, which corresponds with the brightness of its light, and whose essence is said to be love, there arose in my heart a violent palpitation, a general uneasiness seized my whole frame, and I was inwardly excruciated to such a degree that I threw myself flat on the ground.” — Emanuel Swedenborg, <em>The Delights Of Wisdom Pertaining To Conjugal Love</em></p>
