  <h1>Twitness</h1>
  <p>Readers may be aware of my views on <strong><a href="2009-02-10-hooting-yard-on-witter.html" class="internal" title="Hooting Yard On Witter">Twitter</a></strong>. Briefly, I ahbhor it, despite the vaguely ornithological resonance of its name. I am assured, however, that it is increasingly the medium through which people keep abreast of that which is critical to their leading a well-ordered life. And what could be more critical than the doings at Hooting Yard? I have therefore arranged—via the indefatigable technoboffin—for a “tweet” to be generated whenever a new item appears on this website, and whenever a new podcast becomes available from ResonanceFM. I will most assuredly <em>not</em> be tapping idiotic drivel in to Twitter every five minutes.</p>
  <p>If you wish to “follow” Hooting Yard, the stuff on Twitter appears at, unsurprisingly, @hootingyard</p>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> I will also use Twitter to draw attention to intriguing links, for example this one, about a cork-, gutta percha-, and linseed oil-based floor covering called <strong><a href="http://carolineld.blogspot.com/2009/07/kamptulicon.html" class="external">Kamptulicon</a></strong>.</p>
