  <p>Hark! Hark! The dogs do bark</p>
  <p>Upon the deck of Noah's ark.</p>
  <p>Noah decides to muzzle them</p>
  <p>Helped by Japheth, Ham, and Shem.</p>
  <p>Thus the dogs are rendered mute</p>
  <p>So we can hear the dulcet flute</p>
  <p>Played by a chap standing on one leg.</p>
  <p>Not Herman Melville's tar Queequeg,</p>
  <p>This fellow goes by the name of Ian,</p>
  <p>A name emblazoned once in neon</p>
  <p>At vast arenas throughout the land</p>
  <p>For he was the leader of a band</p>
  <p>A hairy band called Jethro Tull</p>
  <p>Now he's beshat on by a gull</p>
  <p>Upon the deck of Noah's ark.</p>
  <p>The bird flies on into the dark.</p>
  <p>The flautist wipes his old tramp's coat,</p>
  <p>Cursing the day he boarded this boat.</p>
  <p>But it rained and rained and rained and rained</p>
  <p>And rained and rained and rained and rained.</p>
  <p>The ark was a lifeline to which he clung,</p>
  <p>And he'd long ago lost his aqualung.</p>
