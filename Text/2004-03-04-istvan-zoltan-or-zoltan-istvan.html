  <h1>Istvan, Zoltan or Zoltan, Istvan</h1>
  <p>“Crikey!” exclaimed Istvan, as he pulled the lever on the incomprehensible big magnetic robot.</p>
  <p>“That's a turn up for the book,” observed his twin brother Zoltan.</p>
  <p>“And what book would that be?” asked Istvan, as the incomprehensible big magnetic robot clanked &amp; whirred into action. Thumping &amp; minatory, it began to cross the buttercup-splattered meadow in which this exciting scene takes place. It made Istvan think of a Golem, such was its implacable menace.</p>
