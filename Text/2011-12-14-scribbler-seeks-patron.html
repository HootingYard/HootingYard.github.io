  <p>This is a foolhardy, if heartfelt, request, and perhaps the season of good will is the time to make it. I am seeking a patron—a wealthy person (or indeed persons), perhaps an oligarch or a plutocrat, one at least to whom my modest requirements seem puny—who could help to place Hooting Yard on a sound financial footing. There are readers and listeners who are very generous—you know who you are, and I thank you—but in this instance I wonder if there is a devotee of sufficient riches who could help not only to keep the wolf from the door, but to keep it penned in some distant wolf-prison. If you think you may have sufficient sense, and wealth, to support an impoverished scribbler, please drop me a line (address <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/regarding-mr-key" class="hootingyard">here</a></strong>). Or, if you cannot help but count among your friends and acquaintances an oligarch or plutocrat or, say, Damien Hirst or Richard Branson, please draw this to their attention.
