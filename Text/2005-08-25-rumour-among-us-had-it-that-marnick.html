  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Rumour among us had it that Marnick maintained special quarters up on the surface… a stone house against the barren rock; and that in this house was a certain room into which Marnick thrust the men who displeased him. Beyond this even rumour failed to go, but we often hazarded guesses. The most prevalent guess was that Marnick released hordes of Callistan Gnishii into this room, then stood at a glass-paned door and shrieked with insane laughter.” — Henry Hasse, <em>Out Of This World</em></p>
