  <h1>The World Trend</h1>
  <p>There are difficult days, like today, when I awake in the grip of the fever. My ablutions are performed hurriedly, as if there is no time to waste, even though it is still before dawn. If I can face breakfast, I bolt it, like a half-starved squirrel alighting upon a single discarded nut on the lawn of a municipal park. I pace up and down, disconsolate, muttering, eyes popping, my hair dishevelled and with beetles falling from it. I wander through the chartered streets and see in every face I meet signs of the same restlessness, signs of the same phrenzy. Aimless and distracted I return home. My limbs are aquiver but I snap them to stillness and manage to make a pot of tea. I turn on the kitchen radio and tune in to <strong><em><a href="http://innocentpastimes.blogspot.com/2009/08/hooting-yard-lost-property-mighty.html" class="external">Tugboat Crew Playtime</a></em></strong>, hoping the tunes will soothe my brain. I feel as if there is a nest of vipers squirming in my vitals, but eventually I gather. I gather. And I walk as boldly as I can across the hall and push open the living room door and I look down…</p>
  <p>And of course, it is fine. It is perfectly serviceable. A tad worn in places, a faded stain here or there, but nothing I cannot cope with. And thus does my <strong><a href="2009-06-18-a-note-on-rugs.html" class="internal" title="A Note On Rugs">carpet madness</a></strong> evaporate, and I am human again, no longer a demented thing.</p>
  <p>I had resigned myself to these periodic attacks, but now it seems help is at hand. If my carpet madness gets worse, there is a remedy. According to the North Korean Central News Agency,</p>
  <p><em>Products of the</em> <em>Pyongyang</em> <em>Carpet Factory are drawing interests of many people at home and abroad.</em></p>
  <p><em>The factory, with a long history of carpet production, is producing various kinds of hand-woven carpet, machine-woven carpet and others to suit the world trend.</em></p>
  <p><em>It is located in Sosong District of</em> <em>Pyongyang</em><em>.</em></p>
  <p><em>Pak Won Chol, director of the factory, said in an interview with KCNA to the following effect: The factory is making silk carpet good for health and longevity which the Korean ancestors had long used and wool carpet giving comfortable feeling.</em></p>
  <p>A doctor once told me he thought my own “episodes” of carpet madness were brought on by a neurotic terror that my carpet did not suit the world trend. If that is indeed the cause, then I now know how to conquer the bonkersness once and for all.</p>
