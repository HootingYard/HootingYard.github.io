  <h1 id="post-58">All Hail Yoko!</h1>
  <p>Today is a very special day at Hooting Yard. It's Yoko Ono's 74th birthday. Just as the people of Tanna, in Vanuatu in the South West Pacific, worship the Duke of Edinburgh as a god, we here at Hooting Yard recognise the divinity of Yoko.</p>
  <p>Our devotion took a bit of a battering a few years ago when Mrs Gubbins dallied with <a href="http://www.instantkarma.com/yostatement499.html" class="external">Yokonetics</a>, but a course of brain-sluicing with Baxter's Terrible Fluid and a visit from Yoko's lawyer set her back on the true path.</p>
  <p>If anyone wants me, I shall be spending this special day in that field near Blister Lane Bypass, sitting in a bag with <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,1993962,00.html" class="external">wool wrapped round my legs</a>, screaming.</p>
