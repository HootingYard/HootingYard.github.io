  <h1>Egg Of Power</h1>
  <p>It is now quite clear that, since the inauguration of Barack Obama as Potus, we can all rest easy in our beds. For I learn that Obama keeps on his desk an <a href="http://counterknowledge.com/2009/01/obama-has-an-egg-of-power-in-the-oval-office/" class="external"><strong>Egg Of Power</strong></a>.</p>
  <p>Could it be that, when he publishes his presidential diaries in years to come, Obama will take a leaf out of <a href="2008-11-28-ova.html" class="internal" title="Ova"><strong>George Orwell's</strong></a> book, and give us simply a daily status report on the egg?</p>
  <p><em>January 31. One egg. But it is the Egg of Power!</em></p>
  <p>The Oval Office may be renamed the Ova Office, and <a href="http://mustardplaster.blogspot.com/2008/10/see-how-theyve-grown.html" class="external"><strong>Alfred Hitchcock</strong></a> will be rolling in his grave.</p>
