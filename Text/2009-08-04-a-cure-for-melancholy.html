  <p>I have always thought the most efficacious cure for melancholy was to lean on the fence of a sty and watch pigs. Help is at hand, however, for the pig-bereft melancholic seeking to ease their woes. <strong><a href="http://danchambers.stodge.org/" class="external">Dan Chambers</a></strong> sent me an extract from an email from his Pa:</p>
  <p><em>In his preface to</em> The Anatomy of Melancholy <em>Burton</em> <em>explains that he wrote the book to rid himself of his own melancholia. This it failed to do; Bishop Kennet wrote that</em> <em>Burton</em><em>‘s only relief from despondency was to lean over the footbridge at</em> <em>Oxford</em> <em>and listen to the bargemen swearing at each other.</em></p>
