  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Once, in passing through my chamber, my attention was so strongly fixed on an absent person that I was not only vividly conscious of his form, but also of his voice and gestures, so that I was amazed by the lively image brought before me. I could adduce other instances from my own experience and that of others to show that in a waking and altogether normal state we may believe in the reality of the image as we do in dreams. This vivid and momentary realization of images is very common in the lower classes.” — Tito Vignoli, <em>Myth And Science</em></p>
