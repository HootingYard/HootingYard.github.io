  <h1 id="post-5907">Tombstone Blues</h1>
  <p>“I am not just a person who goes around peeing on tombs, but a writer with a serious oeuvre.”</p>
  <p>So says one Eduardo Labarca, quoted in today's <em><strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/jan/24/jorge-luis-borges-grave" class="external">Grauniad</a></strong></em>. Proclaiming oneself to be the creator of “a serious oeuvre” is akin to the claim, invariably made by humourless persons, that “I've got a mad sense of humour, me”. Labarca also states “Peeing on that tomb was a legitimate artistic act.” Ah! How delightfully transgressive!</p>
  <p>It briefly occurred to me to court notoriety and publicity by desecrating the grave of, say, Anthony Burgess, but then I realised that I am no longer a teenperson. Nor, for that matter, is the absurd Labarca.</p>
