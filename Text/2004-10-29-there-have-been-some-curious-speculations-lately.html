  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“There have been some curious speculations lately as to the conveyance of mental consciousness by ‘brain-waves'. What does it matter how it is conveyed? The consciousness itself is not a wave. It may be accompanied here or there by any quantity of quivers and shakes, up or down, of anything you can find in the universe that is shakeable—what is that to me?” — John Ruskin, <em>The Queen Of The Air</em></p>
