  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“To my mind one of the most beautiful words in the English language is <em>pavement</em>. Enunciate it, study its sound, and see what you think. It is also indubitable that certain combinations of words have a more beautiful sound than certain other combinations. Thus Tennyson held that the most beautiful line he ever wrote was: <em>The mellow ouzel fluting in the elm</em>. Perhaps, as sound, it was. But does it live in the memory as one of the rare great Tennysonian lines? It does not.” — Arnold Bennett, <em>Literary Taste&nbsp;: How To Form It</em></p>
