  <h1>At Home With Tanquod Shuddery</h1>
  <p>I went to the shops and bought some custard. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em>. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em> and a jam tart. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em> and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em> and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin. I went to the shops and bought some custard and a brooch and a flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em> and a jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin and then I went home and took each item out of its paper bag, and put the paper bags on the fire, and smoke billowed up the chimney, and I saw that it was good, and I declared that it was good, in a loud voice, so loud that my neighbours came a-running, they tumbled into my room in their stockinged feet, and I stood there like a Jack o'Lantern, with my custard and brooch and flap and the Pin of Pang and a copy of <em>Hudibras</em> and my jam tart and four and twenty blackbirds and grease in a big round tin, and I said to my neighbours “Behold what I have bought at the shops, ye neighbourly folk, behold and wonder,” and they did, and I made a pot of tea and handed around cups, and I filled their cups from the pot, and my shopping I distributed to my neighbours as gifts, and their hearts grew warm, and that is what happened when I had what is called an “At Home”, in my simple cottage on the outskirts of the farm, where cows graze and hens cluck, and the farmer has gone to seed.</p>
