  <h1>A Boon for Scholars</h1>
  <p>Reader, raconteur, wit, and Resonance FM podcasting maestro Salim Fadhley has kindly provided the technologically hopeless ingrates at Haemoglobin Towers with a Hooting Yard search facility, which you will have noted above. Harnessing the mighty power of the Dobson™ search engine, those zonk-eyed boffins at Google™ came up with an [insert mumbo jumbo] which allows you, my dear readers, to cut through all the twaddle and home in on precisely the information you require as you study for your doctorate in Hooting Yard studies.</p>
  <p>That scalliwag Pansy Cradledew has already put this amazing new feature to the test. She writes: <em>I have long been of the opinion that 99% of Hooting Yard is the sort of drivel I can well do without. Imagine my delight, then, to find that I can pinpoint with unerring accuracy all mentions of Little Severin the Mystic Badger, about whom I am writing a monograph.</em></p>
  <p>In keeping with this new gung ho approach, I have added to the top of the page an at-a-glance note of the date of the most recent update. What will we think of next?</p>
