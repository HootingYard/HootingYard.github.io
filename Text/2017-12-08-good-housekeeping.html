  <p>I am attempting to do a spot of Hooting Yard housekeeping, delving into the terrifying innards of WordPress to tweak this website here &amp; there. Frankly, I find my brain befuddled, but progress is being made, albeit slowly.</p>
  <p>Thus far, I have managed to make a couple of updates to the sidebar. A while ago, ResonanceFM discontinued its podcasts and, as far as I know, erased them from history. I haven't worked out how to remove the podcasty links over to your right, but I have inserted a link to the Hooting Yard audio archive on Mixcloud. Shows are available there almost as soon as they have been broadcast.</p>
  <p>I recently trod in the puddle of Instagram, and have added a sidebar link so you lot can go and look at pictures posted by out_of_print_pamphleteer.</p>
  <p>I shall keep you informed of further refinements if my brain doers not overheat in the meantime.</p>
  <p><strong>UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> I've also inserted a sidebar Archives section, where you can browse through the morass of potsages [sic] month by month.</p>
  <p><strong>FURTHER UPDATE&nbsp;:</strong> Those podcast links have now been excised. See the Comments, however, for Old Resonance Hooting Yard Podcasts News, and watch this space …</p>
