  <p>In this week's <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/09/some-more-brief-lives/" class="external">Dabbler</a></em></strong> there is a third set of Brief Lives (or Brief, Brief Lives), involving, <em>inter alia</em>, milk, poultry, and idiots.</p>
  <p>In connection with which, Mr Key is about to embark upon a thrilling project which will have the unfortunate effect of becalming Hooting Yard for some while. I will still of course be pouring out sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose, but for a few months there may be fewer postages here than is usual. So if two or three days go by without word, do not fret and imagine I have fallen down a mineshaft or met with some other calamity.</p>
  <p>News of Project Thrilling will be announced in due time.</p>
