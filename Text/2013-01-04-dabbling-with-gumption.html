  <p>Over at <em>The Dabbler</em> you can read an unbearably exciting one-act play entitled <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/01/true-adventures-of-the-child-of-gumption/" class="external">True Adventures Of The Child Of Gumption</a></em></strong>. In the comments, Gaw remarks that he can imagine Peter Jackson at work on a trilogy of film adaptations. You will all be pleased to hear that my people are talking to his people and we think we may be able to stretch it over nine films, a trilogy of trilogies.</p>
