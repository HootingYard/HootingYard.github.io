  <p><em>P is for Piffle</em></p>
  <p>Some people do spout the most extraordinary piffle, and I suppose we should expect the words of politicians to be particularly piffle-strewn. Consider this, reported in today's <em>Grauniad</em>:</p>
  <p>“One of his shadow cabinet allies insisted Ed Miliband was growing in stature as a leader by the hour.”</p>
  <p><em>By the hour?</em> He became the Labour Party leader on Saturday afternoon, and if we grant that to get elected in the first place he must already have demonstrated just a teensiest smidgen of leadership quality, what on earth must he be like by now, and what will he be like in a week's and a month's time? Assuming the next general election takes place in 2015, and his stature continues to grow by the hour, he will have become a mighty potentate, a modern Ozymandias, King of Kings!</p>
