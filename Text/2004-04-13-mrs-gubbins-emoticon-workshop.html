  <h1>Mrs Gubbins' Emoticon Workshop</h1>
  <p>Before her arrest, escape, and current status as a fugitive, Mrs Gubbins was running a very popular “Emoticon Workshop” on Thursday afternoons. The intention—as she noted in her prospectus—was to create a definitive catalogue of emoticons to denote as many human (and inhuman) emotions as possible.</p>
  <p>The workshop's first achievement was to devise emoticons for the four medieval humours (see <em>Dobson's Leech Mishap</em>, 16th March) as shown here:</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">“(-/.</tt> = melancholic</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">;&amp;![]</tt> = choleric</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">v|-)(</tt> = sanguine</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">::}%;</tt> = phlegmatic</p>
  <p>Subsequent sessions proved most profitable. Space precludes us from showing all of the emoticons so far created, but the selection below is evidence of the hard work of Mrs Gubbins and her team. Let us hope they can resume their endeavours soon.</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">(*--¬</tt> = mild peril</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">+=;;'</tt> = attack of the vapours</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">}~@*!</tt> = afflicted with the King's Evil</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">'-)#`</tt> = slated for execution on Tower Hill at dawn</p>
  <p><tt class="emoticon">{}..~</tt> = currently listening to <em>Thick As A Brick</em> by Jethro Tull</p>
