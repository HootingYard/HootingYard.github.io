  <h1 id="post-3368">Matters Of Note</h1>
  <p>Two unrelated matters of note to draw to your attention. I was going to write “two unrelated headlines”, but “headline” suggests news, and one of these is not only three years old but was not a “news headline” even then.</p>
  <p>Though having said they are unrelated it now occurs to me that one could in fact connect the two, or imagine a scenario in which they were jammed together, for example, by using the contraption in (A) to view the incident in (B).</p>
  <p>(A), then, is <strong><em><a href="http://www.retrothing.com/2005/12/build_your_own__1.html" class="external">Build Your Own Dobsonian Telescope</a></em></strong>. Tragically—and I am quite clear about the usage of that word—the Dobson in question is not our beloved out of print pamphleteer, but another Dobson entirely. Still, to discover that such a thing as a Dobsonian telescope exists, and that its creator might, every now and then, be mistaken for <em>our</em> Dobson, is most pleasing.</p>
  <p>(B) is news that a Japanese fishing trawler has been <strong><em><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/6483758/Japanese-fishing-trawler-sunk-by-giant-jellyfish.html" class="external">sunk by giant jellyfish</a></em></strong>. Unfortunately, the details of the story are rather prosaic. You might want to skip them, and instead imagine you are standing upon a promontory on the coast of Japan, peering through your Dobsonian telescope at the terrible sight of a fishing boat being attacked by a hideous semi-transparent sea monster with flailing tentacles.</p>
