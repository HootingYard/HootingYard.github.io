  <h1>Dobson's Heir?</h1>
  <p>Until I read yesterday's <em><a class="external" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,3604,1254741,00.html">Guardian</a></em>, I had never heard of Dr John W Trinkaus. Now, I am thinking of suing him for being a Dobson-impostor. Could anyone have followed Trinkaus' career path without having digested the complete works of the out-of-print pamphleteer? I think not. It turns out that this New York professor is almost as prolific as Dobson himself. Here is a list—by no means complete—of the subjects to which Trinkaus has turned his attention: bicyclists, Brussels sprouts, cases (attaché, opening of), chapel attendance (drop-in), cookies said to be baked by AIDS patients, empty beverage containers, gloves, lodging discount coupons, mentalists, parking areas, physicians' offices (waiting time in), railway terminals, sirens, supermarket checkout delays, tongs and tissues, television game show contestants (handicapped), uncooked ground beef, winter storms (weather persons' predictions of), <em>yes</em> (the word). If that does not make him a Dobsonista, then tie me to a tree and call me Barry, as Max Décharné has been known to say, often on Tuesdays. It turns out that, unlike his precursor, Dr Trinkaus has a considerable presence on the web. Go <a class="external" href="http://www.improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume9/v9i3/trinkaus0.html">here</a> to find out more about him.</p>
