  <h1 id="post-14110">Indisposed</h1>
  <p>Since returning from my jaunt to Belgium I am afraid I have been somewhat indisposed. I shall spare you the details. Suffice to say that my brainpans remain in full (if uninspired) working order. Fine fettle? I would need to consult a qualified fettlist to be sure on that score.</p>
  <p>But things are gradually getting back to normal. There was a new piece in <em><strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2015/09/the-pioneer-plaque-promoting-diversity-beyond-the-solar-system/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></strong></em> on Friday, and after the Resonance summer break <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em> is back on the air. Last week's show is available <strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-24th-september-2015/" class="external">here</a></strong>, and I ought to remind you that each show now appears on Mixcloud almost as soon as it has been broadcast.</p>
  <p>Added to which, my book <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em> is—at long last—published the day after tomorrow. Of which more later.</p>
  <p>In theory I will be back here tomorrow. Fingers crossed.</p>
