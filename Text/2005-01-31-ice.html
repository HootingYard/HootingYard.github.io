  <h1>Ice!</h1>
  <p>Many years ago, on an earlier, vanished version of the Hooting Yard web pages, much attention was paid to ice. Indeed, there was an Ice Project, a collaborative venture the parameters of which were somewhat hazy. In contrast, there has been far too little ice-related material here, and I am aware that this must cause great anguish for many readers. So let me put things right. Look:</p>

  </div>
  <p>Isn't that great? This is one of a set of photographs taken in Geneva last week, and you can look at many, many more of them <a class="external" href="http://www.skyandsummit.com/Glacegeneve/index.html">here</a>.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile, perhaps it is time to resurrect the Hooting Yard Ice Project. Don't fret about pesky distractions like Guidelines For Submissions. Just send in your ice-related material, be it observations, pictures, passages of purple prose, or bagatelles, to the <span class="broken" title="This mailbox is defunct.">Hooting Yard Ice Project Übercoördinator</span>.</p>
