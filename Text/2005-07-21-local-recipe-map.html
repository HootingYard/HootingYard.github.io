  <h1>Local Recipe Map</h1>
  <p>Readers may recall that one of my favourite publications is <em>Further Science</em> by Norman Davies. (See <em>Hedge Auras</em>, 20 <a class="internal" href="2004-02-01-hooting-yard-archive-february-2004.html">February</a> 2004.) I have still not managed to track down any other issues than Book 20, the marvellous A6 yellow-covered spineless 76-page pamphlet from 2001 which, maddeningly, contains no indication of its provenance. Here is Mr Davies' <em>Local Recipe Map</em>, reprinted exactly as it appears in the original:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Far NE Scotland—marmalade / far NW—biscuits / far North—fish.</li>
      <li>Mid SW to NE—Devon / Yorks—rolls—cheese -sausage / cheese.</li>
      <li>So that about a Midlands triangular Pie Nucleus—there are fingers and eggs: hot pots, to the NW—marmalade / ham / loaf to the East. With a ginger NW apex.</li>
      <li>Tarts to the South—with W/E in the far South. Dumplings and Welsh herbs / cakes / fish puddings and scones. Etc.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
  <p>I think we need to arrange a Hooting Yard expedition to the Midlands triangular Pie Nucleus!</p>
