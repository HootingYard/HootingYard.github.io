  <p>Sad news. <em>The Dabbler</em> has been mothballed for an indefinite period—as explained <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2016/02/important-dabbler-announcement/" class="external">here</a></strong>. I have been contributing to it pretty much every week for five and a half years. Those of you with more leisure time than sense may wish to consult the full archive of <strong><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/category/key-cupboard/" class="external">Key's Cupboard</a></strong>. It merely remains for me to thank the redoubtable Brit and the other Dabblers for their support over half a decade. And do not forget that Dabbler Editions published the comprehensive e-anthology <strong><em><a href="2014-01-21-baffling-brilliant-brutal-and-hysterically-funny.html" class="internal" title="Baffling, Brilliant, Brutal, &amp; Hysterically Funny">By Aerostat To Hooting Yard</a></em></strong>, edited and introduced by Roland Clare. If you do not yet have a copy, go and buy one immediately, or you will be set upon in awful nightmares by the Grunty Man.</p>
