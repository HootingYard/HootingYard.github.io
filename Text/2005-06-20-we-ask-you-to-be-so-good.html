  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“We ask you to be so good as to pass a law requiring the closing of all windows, dormers, skylights, inside and outside shutters, curtains, casements, bull's-eyes, deadlights, and blinds—in short, all openings, holes, chinks, and fissures through which the light of the sun is wont to enter houses.” — Frederic Bastiat, <em>A Petition From The Manufacturers Of Candles, Tapers, Lanterns, Sticks, Street Lamps, Snuffers, And Extinguishers, And From Producers Of Tallow, Oil, Resin, Alcohol, And Generally Of Everything Connected With Lighting</em></p>
