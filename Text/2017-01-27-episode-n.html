  <p><strong><a href="https://www.mixcloud.com/Resonance/hooting-yard-on-the-air-26th-january-2017/" class="external">Here</a></strong> is yesterday's episode of <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>, which features Mr Key reading sweeping paragraphs of majestic prose. The show is approaching its thirteenth anniversary, in April, and I rather regret that it never occurred to me (nor to anybody at Resonance) to give each episode a number. It would be pleasant to be able to say “This is <em>Hooting Yard On The Air</em>, Episode 666”, or whatever number we have reached. I suppose there might be a frighteningly fanatical listener out there somewhere who has kept such a tally—if so, I hope they would get in touch and enlighten us all.</p>
