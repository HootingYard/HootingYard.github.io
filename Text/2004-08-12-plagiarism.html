  <h1>Plagiarism</h1>
  <p>Stefan Zweig, whose magnificent <em>Beware Of Pity</em> provided our quote of the day last Friday (6 August), published a book of stories in 1922 entitled <em>Amok&nbsp;: Tales Of Violent Feeling</em>. (It is this collection which includes his most famous story, <em>Letter From An Unknown Woman</em>, memorably filmed by Max Ophuls.) This is such a great title that I am afraid I am going to have to steal it. I hope the Zweig Estate won't get too upset, but I think he is out of copyright anyway, having killed himself, in a double suicide with his wife Lotte Altmann, in Brazil in 1942.</p>

  <p>Here is an off-the-cuff plan for my own <em>Amok&nbsp;: Tales Of Violent Feeling</em>:</p>
  <p><em>The Desperate Spinettist</em>. The tale of a spinettist called Dennis, who becomes desperate when he is attacked by a flock of mutant starlings who have been exposed to fiendish Dr Fang's nerve gas.</p>
  <p><em>Blodgett's Frenzy</em>. Outwardly calm, even insouciant, Blodgett harbours a terrible secret. The man within is a seething mass of neurasthenic horror. When an exhausted bus conductor stumbles upon the truth, the scene is set for a thrilling finale set in an area of numerous ponds.</p>
  <p><em>The Simon &amp; Garfunkel Terror</em>. Claudette, a peasant girl, becomes obsessed with Art Garfunkel's hairstyle. She neglects her cow-herding duties and is subject to violent fits. Can she be cured by a protracted campfire singsong of Paul Simon's solo work, or is she still crazy after all these years?</p>
  <p><em>Vagabond Maniac Goes Bonkers</em>. A wandering minstrel, who may well be Ugo of Plovdiv (see 9 August), suffers concussion and amnesia after an accident involving a moorhen, a speedboat, and a swarm of killer bees. We follow him as he trudges about hither and thither, until he goes berserk. In Plovdiv.</p>
  <p>That will do for now. If any readers would like to contribute their own <em>Tales Of Violent Feeling</em>, send them in!</p>
