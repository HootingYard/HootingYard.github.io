  <h1>Encounter With A Swan</h1>
  <p>One consequence of my recent problems with <strong><a href="2016-08-14-eye-eye-again.html" class="internal" title="Eye Eye (Again)">my eyes</a></strong> is that I am less inclined to visit art galleries and exhibitions. Peering myopically at blurred canvases is not entirely rewarding. Spending a few days in Amsterdam, however, I felt impelled to visit the Rijksmuseum, and I am very pleased that I did. For it was in the “Golden Age” galleries that I encountered the most magnificent painting of a swan that I have ever seen.</p>

  <p>This is <em>The Threatened Swan</em> by Jan Asselijn, painted in 1650. As so often, the reproduction barely does justice to the original, which has a gleaming, translucent whiteness even my poor eyes found spellbinding.</p>
  <p>I saw many actual swans swanning around on the canals of Amsterdam, but none was quite as magnificent as this one.</p>
