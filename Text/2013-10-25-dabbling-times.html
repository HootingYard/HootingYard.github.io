  <p>Over at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/10/times-past/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, my cupboard contains a selection of newspaper headlines which appeared in <em>The Times</em> in 1789 and 1790. Was it really true that the Irish were not refined enough for opera? Did the paper have a regular “Elopements” column? Is it seemly for a clergyman to eat filberts while conducting a burial service? You will not get answers to these important questions, but they are well worth thinking about, are they not?</p>
