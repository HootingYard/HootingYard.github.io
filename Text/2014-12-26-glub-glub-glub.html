  <p>I was exceedingly pleased to receive as a Christmas gift <em>The New Annotated H. P. Lovecraft</em>, a splendid scholarly edition of selected works by the troubled genius of Providence, Rhode Island. It is packed with informative footnotes, but one was missing, so I am taking the opportunity to provide it here as an addendum.</p>
  <p>Among my favourite snippets of Lovecraft is this passage from <em>The Thing On The Doorstep</em>. My footnote is appended.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>It began with a telephone call just before midnight. I was the only one up, and sleepily took down the receiver in the library. No one seemed to be on the wire, and I was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end. Was someone trying under great difficulties to talk? As I listened I thought I heard a sort of half-liquid bubbling noise—“glub… glub… glub”—which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate, unintelligible word and syllable divisions. I called “Who is it?” But the only answer was “glub… glub… glub-glub.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>NOTE&nbsp;:</strong> In the early 1990s, “Glub … glub … glub” was the recorded answerphone message of Ed Baxter, benevolent despot of ResonanceFM.</p>
