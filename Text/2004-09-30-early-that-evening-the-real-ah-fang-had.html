  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Early that evening, the real Ah-Fang had been waylaid by a stalwart, roughlooking character who had thrust a peculiarly shaped gun into the Chinese's face.A jet of powerful anesthetizing vapor had shot from that gun. Ah-Fang had dipped into unconsciousness and had been whisked away in a powerful motor car. For the stalwart man was none other than Secret Agent “X” concealed behind another of his masterly disguises. No identity was too difficult for him to assume. His special plastic volatile compound could be molded to resemble the contours of any face. His own formulated pigments, clever toupees, faceplates, and other elements of make-up, had enabled him to create for himself the exact replica of the face of Ah-Fang.” — Brant House, <em>The Golden Ghoul</em></p>
