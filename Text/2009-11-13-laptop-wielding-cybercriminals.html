  <p>While watching <em>Die Hard 4.0</em> the other day, it occurred to me that things might pan out very differently if, in films featuring laptop-wielding cybercriminals, the malefactors had to rely on PCs using Windows Vista.</p>
  <p><em>Criminal mastermind cackles evilly and issues a command to his technowhizz sidekick.</em></p>
  <p><em>“Upload the virus now!”</em></p>
  <p><em>Sidekick nods, taps the keys… and on his screen, a message appears:</em></p>
  <p><em>“Please wait. Windows is checking for updates and carrying out several other incomprehensible and purposeless activities. This may take a few minutes, or possibly hours, during which time your computer will make little whirring noises. Do not power off or unplug your machine.”</em></p>
