  <h1>139 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)</h1>
  <p>It is traditional, at the turning of the year, for reader Mike Jennings to update his exhaustive bibliography of out of print pamphlets by Dobson. “It seems that 2011 has been a lean year indeed for Dobsonian scholarship,” writes Mr Jennings from the pompous land of his banishment. Nevertheless, he has managed to track down eleven, or rather twelve, previously unidentified titles, and he is once again to be commended for his thoroughness, not least in assigning those pesky, but lovely, Blötzmann Numbers to the pamphlets he has unearthed. One day we might be able to work out their significance.</p>
  <p>There are earlier listings for pamphlets numbered <strong><a href="2010-01-15-104-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="104 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">1 to 104</a></strong>, and pamphlets numbered <strong><a href="2011-01-14-128-pamphlets-out-of-print.html" class="internal" title="128 Pamphlets (Out Of Print)">105 to 128</a></strong>. Please note that, unless stated otherwise, all titles are out of print.</p>
