  <p>“Following the approved practice, two large vases, containing ‘a representative sample of contemporary items', were deposited in the pedestal [of Cleopatra's Needle, on Thames Embankment]. ‘The mere list of these objects,’ declared the <em>Saturday Review</em>, ‘must provoke a smile.’ It was certainly well-calculated to have this effect, for, among them, were a Bible, a translation of the hieroglyphics on the column, a portrait of the Queen, a standard set of weights and measures, a <em>Whitaker's Almanack</em>, a Bradshaw's railway-guide, a Post Office directory, a ‘Mappin's shilling razor’, an ‘Alexandra feeding-bottle, as used in the Royal nurseries', and ‘photographs of twelve pretty Englishwomen’. Altogether, a mixed assortment.”</p>
  <p>Horace Wyndham, <em>This Was The News&nbsp;: An Anthology Of Victorian Affairs</em> (1948)</p>
  <p>Is all that stuff still there, entombed in vases beneath the Needle?</p>
