  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“In these colossal chambers the phosphorescent light from enormous radiators beats incessantly through and through the slowly oscillating, vibrating, revolving soul matter. And here the process of individualization is achieved. A soul, or many souls, are separated from the great tide, by flashing, under the bombardment of the phosphorescent blaze into shining forms. They assume a shape outlined by light, and just slightly subject to gravity from the atomic compression necessary to maintain their illumination, they fall lightly out from the domes of the spheres, touch the floors beneath, and are led away. In this way I found later I had arrived at Mars.“—L P Gratacap, <em>The Certainty Of A Future Life In Mars</em></p>
