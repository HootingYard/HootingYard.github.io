  <h1 id="post-13879">The Plumless Land</h1>
  <p>He went to an orchard with his chums<br />
  And they stole a punnet's worth of plums<br />
  Then they scampered off to their hideaway<br />
  As the last light faded from the day<br />
  The sky grew dark, then darker, black<br />
  They transferred the plums into a sack<br />
  Then they tumbled out of their hideaway tent<br />
  And round the town in the night they went<br />
  Depositing plums from door to door<br />
  Mischief that was against the law<br />
  For in that town plums had been banned<br />
  As elsewhere in that plumless land<br />
  According to the king's decree<br />
  Chim-chim-cheroo, chim-chim-cheree<br />
  (The king looked just like Dick Van Dyke)<br />
  Plums were a fruit he did not like<br />
  Why then, you ask, did he allow<br />
  The orchard's trees, bough upon bough<br />
  To sprout so many Carlsbad plums?<br />
  Let us ask the little chums.<br />
  But oh! They've vanished in the night<br />
  Now they're completely out of sight<br />
  O'er the hills and far away<br />
  As dawn breaks on a brand new day<br />
  And townsfolk find plums on their <em>stoeps</em><br />
  They greet them with shrill cries and whoops<br />
  And hide them quick before King Claus<br />
  Comes on his rounds from house to house<br />
  If he finds a plum his wrath will wax<br />
  And cause umpteen heart attacks<br />
  So hide your plums well, folks of the town<br />
  Till human voices wake you, and you drown.</p>
