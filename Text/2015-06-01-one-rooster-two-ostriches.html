  <p>Dear Mr. Key,, <em>writes Poppy Nisbet from her fastness in North America,</em> There was an offer on Freecycle this morning for a “disabled rooster”. I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. It read: “Offer: disabled rooster”.</p>
  <p>Likewise, on the bird front, I found a wonderful 17th century engraving of two standing desert ostriches blowing on their eggs. After dogged persistence Google finally produced a translation of the accompanying Latin text and I learned that ostriches were believed to leave their eggs to hatch in the care of the sun and the sand. The parent birds blew “nourishing breathe” onto their offspring before, er, deserting them.</p>
  <p>The translation given for ostrich was “Sparrow-camel”.</p>
