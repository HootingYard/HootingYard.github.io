  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Moreover, I may properly quaery, which of the wisest Philosophers is so Sage, as to be able to comprehend with the acuteness of his own most dextrous ingeny, with what Obumbracle the Imaginative Tinging, Venemons, or Monstrous Faculty of any pregnant Woman, compleats its work in one Moment, if it be deduced into art by some External Object?” — John Frederick Helvetius, <em>The Golden Calf, Which The World Adores, And Desires</em></p>
