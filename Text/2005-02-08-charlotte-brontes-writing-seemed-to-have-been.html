  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Charlotte Bronte's writing seemed to have been traced with a cambric needle, and Thackeray's writing, while marvelously neat and precise, was so small that the best of eyes were needed to read it. Likewise the writing of Captain Marryatt was so microscopic that when he was interrupted in his labors he was obliged to mark the place where he left off by sticking a pin in the paper. Napoleon's was worse than illegible, and it is said that his letters from Germany to the Empress Josephine were at first thought to be rough maps… Byron's handwriting was nothing more than a scrawl. The writing of Dickens was minute, and he had a habit of writing with blue ink on blue paper.” — Jerome B Lavay, <em>Disputed Handwriting&nbsp;: An Exhaustive, Valuable, And Comprehensive Work Upon One Of The Most Important Subjects of To-day</em></p>
