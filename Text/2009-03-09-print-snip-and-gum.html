  <h1>Print, Snip, ‘n’ Gum</h1>
  <p>At the risk of this becoming a muffincentric website, I think it is important that readers are given the fruits of Glyn Webster's tireless—if no doubt tiring—researches into what the OED defines as a small, flat, cake made from yeast batter and cooked on a hotplate, usually eaten split, toasted, and spread with butter, jam, etc., esp. for breakfast or tea. Interestingly, in the dictionary's first citation, from 1703, it is spelled <em>Moofin</em>, and in the second, from 1747, <em>Muffing</em> (capitalisation in the originals). I wonder if it is too late to beat against the tides of history and to reintroduce one or other of these spellings?</p>
  <p>Anyway, the only reason I have returned to this possibly inexhaustible topic is that, having apprised himself of the difference between true Moofins and what the rest of the world outside Britain think is a Muffing, Mr Webster has kindly provided these cut-out “patches” or “plug-ins” for your <strong><a href="2009-03-08-heraldic-muffin-device.html" class="internal" title="Heraldic Muffin Device">heraldic muffin device</a></strong>. Just print, snip, ‘n’ gum!</p>
