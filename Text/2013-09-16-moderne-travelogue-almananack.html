  <blockquote>
    <p>I was overcome with a sudden panic; to have come so far only to have to turn around and go back, unable to keep up with the local dialect, a distinct and lilting mixture of my own native tongue and a leprechaun's mystical chatter.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Thus my nephew Vinnie Byrne, a native of <strong><a href="http://hootingyard.org/archive/sep04.htm#2004-09-02-2" class="hootingyard">Pining And Pothorst Land</a></strong>, currently making a grand tour of Old Europe. Wisely, he has decided to write a <strong><a href="http://modernetravelogue.tumblr.com/" class="external">blog</a></strong> about his travels, and very good it is too. I urge you lot to go and read it.</p>
