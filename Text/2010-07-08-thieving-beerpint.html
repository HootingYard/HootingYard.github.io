  <p>It saddens me to report that weedy poet Dennis Beerpint has been caught red-handed in an act of plagiarism. His verse “The Fountainhead&nbsp;: Homage à Ayn Rand” from his well-received recent collection <em>A Series Of Homages To Female Right-Wing Russo-American Postage Stamp Collectors</em> was, it seems, lifted word for word from this paragraph in <em>Compound Words&nbsp;: A Study Of The Principles Of Compounding, The Components Of Compounds, And The Use Of The Hyphen</em> by Frederick W. Hamilton, LL. D., published in 1918 by the Committee on Education of the United Typothetae Of America:</p>
  <p>“41. Following is a list of words of everyday occurrence which should be hyphenated, and which do not fall under any of the above classifications.</p>
  <p><em>after-years food-stuff sea-level</em></p>
  <p><em>bas-relief guinea-pig sense-perception</em></p>
  <p><em>birth-rate horse-power son-in-law</em></p>
  <p><em>blood-relations loan-word subject-matter</em></p>
  <p><em>common-sense man-of-war thought-process</em></p>
  <p><em>cross-examine object-lesson title-page</em></p>
  <p><em>cross-reference page-proof wave-length</em></p>
  <p><em>cross-section pay-roll well-being</em></p>
  <p><em>death-rate poor-law well-nigh</em></p>
  <p><em>folk-song post-office will-power</em></p>
  <p><em>fountain-head</em></p>
  <p>These rules are the consensus of opinion of a considerable number of good authorities from DeVinne (1901) to Manly and Powell (1913).”</p>
  <p>The only change Dennis Beerpint makes is to add an exclamation mark after “fountain-head”, presumably to remind himself to shout the word, triumphantly, at recitals.</p>
