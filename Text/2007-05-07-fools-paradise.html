  <h1 id="post-148">Fool's Paradise</h1>
  <p>I must apologise to readers for the distinct lack of recent posts. I have been preoccupied with a number of matters which have left me, bafflingly, bereft of fresh insights into the world o' Hooting Yard. I expect my pea-sized yet pulsating brain will soon generate further reports from that fool's paradise, but in the meantime readers may like to send in suggestions for areas of investigation.</p>
  <p>Although I have not been writing, I have been reading, and it seems only polite to share with you just a few of the things I have learned during the past couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>One of the Heaven's Gate suicides, the followers of Marshall Herff Applewhite (“Do”) and Bonnie Lu Nettles (“Ti”) who hoped to join a spaceship trailing in the wake of the Hale-Bopp comet in 1997, was the brother of Nichelle Nicholls, who played Lieutenant Uhura in the original <em>Star Trek</em> series.</p>
  <p>Stalin and Trotsky first met each other on Whitechapel Road, on the site which is now occupied by a McDonald's.</p>
  <p>Unlike the guinea pig, which is neither from Guinea nor a pig, the Bath Oliver biscuit is not misleadingly named. It was invented in the town of Bath by Dr William Oliver in the eighteenth century.</p>
  <p>Mao Tse-Tung never brushed his teeth nor took a bath or shower. A factotum was employed to rub him down with hot towels when he became grubby.</p>
  <p>More soon…</p>
