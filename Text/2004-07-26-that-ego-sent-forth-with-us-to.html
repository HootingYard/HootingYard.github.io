  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“That Ego sent forth with us to make blithe the voyage, we cannot go a-dancing with him out to fairy fields, because our feet are heavy with Other People's clogs and fetters, we cannot hear when he would whisper at our ear gentle philosophies—our own Self's and no one's else, because of the grave grubby Book-people who thunder at us from our shelves.” — Winifred Margaretta Kirkland, <em>The Joys Of Being A Woman &amp; Other Papers</em></p>
