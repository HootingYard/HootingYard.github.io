  <p><em>Tiny Enid's diary for this day in 1934.</em></p>
  <p>Milk slops for breakfast, washed down with gin. Read a fascinating article in <em>The Ipsy Dipsy Doo</em> about Mussolini, Il Duce in faraway Italy. Having thoroughly digested it I decided to set off for the railway station to make the trains run on time. This is precisely the sort of activity a plucky tot such as myself ought to be engaged in.</p>
  <p>On my way to the station I encountered a tearaway pulling the wings off flies. I kicked his head in and then made him glue the wings back on using a glue composed of his own blood, spittle, and bone marrow. Then I made him swear a solemn vow to be an upstanding citizen for the rest of his natural life. It is a shame such ne'er-do-wells can no longer be transported to Botany Bay.</p>
  <p>Thinking of Botany Bay made me think of botany, so I paused by the railway embankment to pick some peonies and marigolds. Because of my deeds of derring-do and penchant for violence people often forget that I am just a simple little girly and take great pleasure in my flower press. Sometimes I fancy I hear the flowers shrieking as I press every last smidgen of life out of them.</p>
  <p>At the railway station, the dithering old station master, Mr Cribbins, was faffing about with flags and hooters. Needless to say <em>he</em> cannot make the trains run on time. I lured him to some sidings by pretending my little dolly was trapped in the rails, then buried him up to his neck in coarse sand. I read him the riot act, or at least a version of it improvised by Il Duce, translated into English by my mysterious mentor. Back on the platform, I took up Mr Cribbins' flag and hooter and deployed them in such a manner that I struck fear into the hearts of train drivers throughout the land. It was a good morning's work.</p>
  <p>Later I cut this picture out of a magazine:</p>
