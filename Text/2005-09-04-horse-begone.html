  <h1>Horse Begone</h1>
  <p>I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still.</p>
  <p>“Da doo ron ron, horse begone!” she cried. It was an incantation, in a field, and sure enough, the horse to whom she addressed these words turned and cantered away, until it could no longer be seen in the mist and the drizzle.</p>
  <p>Somebody told me that her name was Jill, but before I could ask her, she was casting her spells again.</p>
  <p>“Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!” she yelled, at a cow, but this time without the desired effect. The cow just stared back at her, chewing its cud, the way cows do.</p>
  <p>“Hoo-di hoo-di woo, cow begone!” she repeated, a little desperately, I thought. If I'd been the cow, I would have sensed a moment of panic, of confidence drained. Jill—if Jill was her name—repeated her incantation too soon. The cow did not move.</p>
  <p>So I took the opportunity to stride purposefully across the field in my creaking black boots until I was face to face with her.</p>
  <p>“Somebody told me that your name is Jill,” I said, essaying a bow as if I were some sort of Regency fop.</p>
  <p>“My name is not Jill,” she hissed, “I am the Woohoohoodiwoodadooronron Woman. Fop begone!” and I found myself propelled by some eldritch force into a weird netherworld where I languish to this day, my only companion the horse. There is no sign of the cow.</p>
