  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“As an introduction to the Jesuit priest's choreography, Kahn performed <em>Overwhelmed</em>, an expressionistic evocation of a dark emotional state that suggested sacred dance only in a few gestures of prayer. Set to a recording of prepared piano music by John Cage, the brief piece ended with the exhausted dancer lying in a heap as the stage darkened. When the lights came up, Kahn had disappeared, and <a class="external" href="http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v6/d11/vereecke.html">VerEecke</a> had taken her place in the same crumpled position. Rising from the floor, he cried out to God, ran around the periphery of the stage and pounded his fists against the rear wall. His cries of the heart were picked up and developed in lyrical movements by ten dancers who had learned the graceful choreography in VerEecke's workshop.” — Wilma Salisbury, dance critic, <em>The Plain Dealer</em> July 1999</p>
