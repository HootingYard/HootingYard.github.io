  <p>“You can't cite statements internal to a document to back up the claim that the document is inspired by God and that it is truth without any mixture of error. That doesn't work, and it doesn't work for reasons that are so obvious that failure to grasp them is simply childish. If that did work then all authors could just say ‘this book is inspired by God and it is truth without any mixture of error’ and be taken seriously.”—Ophelia Benson at <a href="http://www.butterfliesandwheels.com/notesarchive.php?id=2551" class="external"><strong>Butterflies And Wheels</strong></a>.</p>
  <p>Well, it may be childish to so aver, but Mr Key's prose is inspired by the hideous bat-god Fatso, and it is truth without any mixture of error. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, as they say.</p>
