  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“One day the Lord gathered together all the insects in the world, all the beetles, bugs, bees, mosquitoes, ants, locusts, grasshoppers, and other creatures who fly or hop or crawl, and shut them up in a huge sack well tied at the end. What a queer, squirming, muffled-buzzing bundle it made, to be sure! Then the Lord called the woman to him and said, ‘Woman, I would have you take this sack and throw it into the sea’.” — Abbie Farwell Brown, <em>The Curious Book Of Birds</em></p>
