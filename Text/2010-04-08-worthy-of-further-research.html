  <p>“I not only investigated the so-called supernatural powers of the child known as the Infant Magnet, but, on a public stage, during the performance of certain mysterious phenomena by a young lady who shall be nameless, I consented to be locked up in a dark cabinet with that interesting maiden, whose toilette was superb.”</p>
  <p>William Manning, <em>Recollections Of Robert-Houdin, Clockmaker, Electrician, Conjuror</em> (1890)</p>
