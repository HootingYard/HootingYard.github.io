  <p>Bela Tarr's <em><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satantango" class="external">Sátántangó</a></strong></em> sounds like my kind of film. Indeed, I'm astonished that it has only just come to my attention, given that it was released in 1994. Clearly I am not keeping up with things as energetically as I ought to be. <em>Sátántangó</em> is seven and a half hours long, in black and white, set on a collapsing collective farm in Hungary, and the opening shot, which lasts for almost eight minutes, follows a herd of Hungarian cows trudging around a collapsing collective farmyard. I have not yet seen it, but I suspect I will adore it.</p>
