  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“He was wholly absorbed in the making of a nondescript machine, a sort of crude harmonica with a clock-spring reed, a magnet, and a wire. It was a most absurd toy in appearance. It was unlike any other thing that had ever been made in any country. The young professor had been toiling over it for three years and it had constantly baffled him, until, on this hot afternoon in June, 1875, he heard an almost inaudible sound—a faint <em>twang</em>—come from the machine itself. ‘Snap that reed again, Watson’, cried the apparently irrational young professor.” — Herbert N Casson, <em>The History Of The Telephone</em></p>
