  <p>“It seems also not very easie, for a Man in his Sermon to learn his Parishioners how to dissolve Gold; of what, and how the stuff is made. Now, to ring the Bells, and call the People on purpose together, would be but a blunt business; but to do it neatly, and when no Body look'd for it, that's the rarity and art of it. Suppose, then, that he takes for his text that of <em>St. Matthew, Repent ye, for the</em> <em>Kingdom</em> <em>of</em> <em>God</em> <em>is at hand</em>. Now tell me, Sir, do you not perceive the Gold to be in a dismal fear, to curl and quiver at the first reading of these words. It must come in thus: <em>The blotts and blurrs of our sins must be taken out by the</em> Aqua-fortis <em>of our Tears; to which</em> Aqua-fortis <em>if you put a fifth part of</em> Sal-Amoniack, <em>and set them in a gentle heat, it makes</em> Aqua-Regia, <em>which dissolves Gold.</em> And now 'tis out. Wonderfull are the things that are to be done by the help of metaphors and similitudes! And I'll undertake, that with a little more pains and consideration, out of the very same words, he could have taught the People how to make Custards, Marmalade, or to stew Prunes.”</p>
  <p>John Eachard, <em>The Grounds And Occasions Of The Contempt Of The Clergy And Religion</em> (1670)</p>
