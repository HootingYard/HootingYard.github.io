  <blockquote>
    <p>10/20&nbsp;: Attacked in hammocks by tiny gnat not over one tenth of an inch in length; mosquito nets no protection; gnats bite all night allowing no sleep.</p>
    <p>10/21&nbsp;: Another sleepless night on account of blood-sucking gnats.</p>
    <p>10/22&nbsp;: My body mass of bumps from insect bites, wrists and hands swollen from bites of tiny gnats. 2 nights with almost no sleep—simply terrible. Rain during noon, all afternoon and most of night. My shoes have been soaked since starting. Worst ticks so far.</p>
    <p>10/23&nbsp;: Horrible night with worst biting gnats yet; even smoke of no avail.</p>
    <p>10/24: More than half ill from insects. Wrists and hands swollen. Paint limbs with iodine.</p>
    <p>10/25&nbsp;: Arose to find termites covering everything left on the ground. Blood-sucking gnats still with us.</p>
    <p>10/30&nbsp;: Sweat bees, gnats and “polverinahs” (blood-sucking gnats) terrible.</p>
    <p>11/2&nbsp;: My right eye is sadly blurred by gnats.</p>
    <p>11/3&nbsp;: Bees and gnats worse than ever; truly “there's no rest for the weary”.</p>
    <p>11/5&nbsp;: My first experience with flesh- and carrion-eating bees. Biting gnats in clouds—very worst we have encountered—rendering one's food unpalatable by filling it with their filthy bodies, their bellies red and disgustingly distended with one's own blood.</p>
