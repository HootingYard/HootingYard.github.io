  <h1>Boiling My Lady Kent's Pudding</h1>
  <p><em>In looking through</em> Thaumaturgia, or Elucidations Of The Marvellous <em>the other day, for that quotation about the delusional <strong><a href="2009-02-18-the-glass-man.html" class="internal" title="The Glass Man">glass man</a></strong>, I came across this:</em></p>
  <p>We shall conclude our astrological strictures with the following advertisement, which affords as fine a satirical specimen of quackery as is to be met with. It is extracted from “poor Robin's” almanack for 1773; and may not be without its use, to many at the present day. We will vouch for it being harmless, but as we are not in the secret of all that it contains, our readers must endeavour to get the information that may be wanted, on certain important points, from other quarters…</p>
  <p>ADVERTISEMENT.</p>
  <p>“The best time to cut hair. How moles and dreams are to be interpreted. When most proper season to bleed. Under what aspect of the moon best to draw teeth, and cut corns. Pairing of nails, on what day unlucky. What the kindest sign to graft or inoculate in; to open bee-hives, and kill swine. How many hours boiling my Lady Kent's pudding requires. With other notable questions, fully and faithfully resolved, by me Sylvester Patridge, student in physic and astrology, near the Gun in Moorfields.”</p>
  <p>“Of whom likewise may be had, at reasonable rates, trusses, antidotes, elixirs, love-powders. Washes for freckles, plumpers, glass-eyes, false calves and noses, ivory-jaws, and a new receipt to turn red hair into black.”</p>
