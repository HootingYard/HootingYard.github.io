  <h1 id="post-4341">Yes, We Remember!</h1>
  <p>I am fairly sure the answer to this question is a resounding “Yes!”</p>
  <p>“Can we not all remember the time when, on first taking to heart Milton, and afterwards Akenside,—(before knowing anything of Dante,) we conceived the grandest moment of possible existence to be that of a Seraph, poised on balanced wings, watching the bringing out of a world from chaos, its completion in fitness, beauty and radiance, and its first motion in its orbit, when sent forth by the creative hand on its everlasting way?”</p>
  <p>Harriet Martineau, <em>Life In The Sick-Room&nbsp;: Essays Of An Invalid</em> (1844)</p>
