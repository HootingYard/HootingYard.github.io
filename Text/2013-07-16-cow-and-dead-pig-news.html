  <h1 id="post-11726">Cow (And Dead Pig) News</h1>
  <p>Here at Hooting Yard we are, as you know, ever vigilant for news of lethal or otherwise miscreant cows. We could not fail to take note of the <strong><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jul/14/brazilian-man-killed-cow-roof" class="external">alarming tale</a></strong> of the Brazilian man killed by a cow falling through his roof.</p>
  <p>Elsewhere, though it is hardly “news”, we learn from a <strong><a href="http://longstreet.typepad.com/thesciencebookstore/2013/07/children_in_insane_asylum.html" class="external">list</a></strong> of children detained in a Worcestershire insane asylum between 1854 and 1900 that one poor little tot was there because he or she was “frightened by a cow”. Whatever terrors the cow may have provoked pale beside an entry further down the list, which tells us that another mite was placed in the asylum after “being put inside a recently killed pig”. To which one can only respond with a blood-curdling “eek!”.</p>
