  <h1>Treats In Store</h1>
  <p>Back in the summer of 2008, I had cause to <strong><a href="2008-07-24-all-around-my-hat.html" class="internal" title="All Around My Hat">mention</a></strong> Sabine Baring-Gould, author of innumerable works including a sixteen-volume <em>Lives Of The Saints</em>, a study of werewolves, grave desecration and cannibalism, and a biography of Robert Stephen Hawker (1803–1875), the eccentric country vicar who spent much of his time smoking opium in a clifftop hut made from driftwood, talked to birds, dressed up as a mermaid, excommunicated his cat, and kept a pet pig.</p>
  <p>I am pleased to report that this morning, at the London Library, recalling Baring-Gould, and brimming with glee, I borrowed his Hawker biography (<em>The Vicar Of Morwenstow</em>, 1886), a collection of pieces entitled <em>Curiosities Of Olden Times</em> (1869), and a biography of the great man himself, <em>Onward Christian Soldier&nbsp;: A Life Of Sabine Baring-Gould, Parson, Squire, Novelist, Antiquary 1834–1924</em> by William Purcell (1957).</p>
  <p>This trio of tomes will, I expect, contain much that is diverting and instructive and I shall share the more startling bits with you when I buckle down to reading them.</p>
