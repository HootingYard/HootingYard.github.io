  <p>Regular readers will know that here at Hooting Yard we do our utmost to keep up with innovations in the world o' gruel, pap and slops. Someone has to, and who better for the task than our team of tireless Gruel And Pap And Slops Monitors hunched over their consoles from dawn to dusk and then again from dusk to dawn? Anyway, one such Monitor has just alerted me to a newly-sighted slop, spotted on the BBC, where Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable spoke of “credit default slops”. The term will be added to our database after a due period of slobbering.</p>
