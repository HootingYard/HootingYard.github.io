  <p>From the “What are you reading?” column in this week's <strong><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/books/reviews-what-are-you-reading-7-july-2016" class="external"><em>Times Higher Education</em>:</a></strong></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Tony Mann, director of the Maths Centre, University of Greenwich, is reading Frank Key's <em>Mr Key's Shorter Potted Brief, Brief Lives</em> (Constable, 2015) and <em>By Aerostat to Hooting Yard: A Frank Key Reader</em> (Dabbler, 2014, Kindle edition). “Thanks to a reading at the excellent Greenwich Book Festival I have discovered the work of Frank Key, whose humour is reminiscent of both Wodehouse and Beckett. His stories of his imagined world, with evocative place-names and regularly recurring characters like the out-of-print pamphleteer Dobson and the ‘fictional athlete’ Bobnit Tivol, are unsettling, vaguely sinister and very funny.”</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Clearly a very sensible Mann.</p>
