  <p>From <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,1853108,00.html" class="external"><em><strong>Necropolis&nbsp;: London And Its Dead</strong></em></a> by Catharine Arnold:</p>
  <p>“One of the most spectacular monuments [in Kensal Green cemetery] is the Â£3,000 tomb of Andrew Ducrow, an Egyptian extravaganza that <em>The Builder</em> dismissed as ‘ponderous coxcombry’. Ducrow (1793–1842) was a showman, ‘the Colossus of Equestrians', who wrestled with lions, re-enacted scenes from Napoleonic battles, and could lift four or five children using nothing more than his teeth.”</p>
  <p>We are not told if the children in question were pious Victorian orphans, but I expect they were.</p>
