  <p>Hmm… a bit of a gap there while I did my impersonation of the Sick Man of Europe. In such circumstances, Ms Cradledew invariably recommends Morrison's Liver Pills, or Dr Gillespie's Bile Regulator &amp; Brain Tonic, or some such potion. Upon her return from foreign shores—which is imminent—I shall ask her to provide a short essay expounding upon her knowledge of old patent remedies. But let us get back to business.</p>
