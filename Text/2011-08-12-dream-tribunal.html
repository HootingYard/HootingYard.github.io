  <h1 id="post-7110">Dream Tribunal</h1>
  <p>In my dream last night, I attended, as an observer, a revolutionary tribunal held in a sort of warehouse, where the members of Henry Cow were arraigned before a committee of hardline Irish Maoists, charged with imperialist deviation. I am afraid to say it was decided that Chris Cutler be taken out and shot.</p>
