  <h1>Pirated Hooting Yard Merchandise</h1>
  <p>The tentacles of Hooting Yard continue to writhe in a hideously Lovecraftian manner around the world. The latest instance of this is the appearance of pirated merchandise. I am extraordinarily pleased to note that readers can now obtain a very special mug from which to gulp down their Cuppagruel™.</p>

    <p class="imagerow"><img src="../Images/2006-01-mug.jpg" alt="Pirated Hooting Yard Merchandise: Mug" class="medium" /></p>
  </div>
  <p>The mug is emblazoned with the “Implausible” logo and is outrageously expensive. Having tracked down the ingrate behind this pathetic get-rich-quick scheme, I am assured that if it sells in sufficient quantities, I might receive a one-off payment of about thirty five pence. So I implore every single reader to go and buy one immediately!
