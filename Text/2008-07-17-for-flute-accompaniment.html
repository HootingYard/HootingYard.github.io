  <h1 id="post-481">For Flute Accompaniment</h1>
  <p>Bring me a cuppet of foaming grog! And bring me some rags to mop up the spillage! Bring me a lantern to light my way through the gruesome lanes of your gruesome village!</p>
  <p>Bring me gas trapped inside a bulb! Bring me a pig on a platter of lead! Bring me your huddled, bring me your sick, bring me your puny and bring me your dead!</p>
  <p>Bring me things I haven't asked for yet! Bring me a badger torn from its sett! Bring me creatures from the bottom of the sea twitching and flapping and flailing in nets!</p>
  <p>Bring me the kind of aftershave used by Peter Wyngarde playing Jason King! God blast you, bring me just about anything!</p>
  <p>There is nothing that I do not crave as I sit here in my cold damp cave, banished from the palace where I sat on a divan, the potentate of my vanquished clan. We were vanquished good and proper by the Men With Whisks. It was all recorded on compact discs. They even had a backing band as they smashed each bone and skull. I can't be sure, but I think it was Jethro Tull.</p>
