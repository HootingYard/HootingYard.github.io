  <h1>Tundism</h1>
  <p>Readers will recall that Mrs Gubbins has managed to elude the police by gaining sanctuary with the Tundists. We have just received the latest brochure from the Tundist Owl Library and are delighted to report that the octogenarian crone has been appointed general editor of the <em>Pamphlets About Owls For Tiny Tots</em> series, which is certainly in need of a revival. Since the previous editor, Mr Binder, collapsed on a hillside twenty years ago, there has been only one addition to the series, the frankly unreadable <em>Preen Your Owl With Verve &amp; Gusto</em>. According to the new brochure, Mrs Gubbins has exciting plans to issue at least two new pamphlets a week. We have sent a coded message asking if we can reprint some of them here, and await her reply.</p>
