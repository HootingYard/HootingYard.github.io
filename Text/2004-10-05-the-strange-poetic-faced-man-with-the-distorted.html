  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“The strange poetic-faced man with the distorted mind was fast. He was faster than even Doc had dreamed. He pitched sidewise, got behind some of his men, went on—toward the snow hole that led into one of the smaller connecting igloos… The hairy chemist's great hands made the victim scream.” — Kenneth Robeson, <em>Fortress Of Solitude</em></p>
