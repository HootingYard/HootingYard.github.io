  <h1>A Word Game</h1>
  <p>The logophiliac barber Nuttawood Sirinuntananon used the above five sentences from Knox's pulp non-classic as the basis for a word game which he unsuccessfully marketed under the name <em>Johnfowlesopoly</em>. Despite its commercial failure, the game is a great favourite at Hooting Yard, and the rules (such as they are) are simple.</p>
  <p>Taking the adjectives from Knox's passage—in alphabetical order, <em>bestial</em>, <em>big</em>, <em>debauched</em>, <em>fashionable</em>, <em>foreign-made</em>, <em>jaded</em>, <em>neurotic</em>, <em>sickening</em>, and <em>whirling</em>—players are given five minutes to compose a very short tale suitable as a bedtime story for infants. All nine adjectives must be used, but free rein is given for the rest of the text. Extra points are awarded if the word <em>plodded</em> is also included.</p>
  <p>Readers are encouraged to play this at home on one of those dismal evenings when life seems unbearable, and to send in their entries for inclusion in a forthcoming anthology.</p>
