  <h1 id="post-11566">A Glut Of Leeks</h1>
  <p>Looking back on my life, I believe one of the greatest challenges I ever had to face was when I found myself in possession of a glut of leeks. It was the first—so far the only—time fate brought me to such a pass, so it is no wonder that I was at sixes and sevens. And let me assure you that I had many, many more leeks than six or seven. I had a glut of them, and I did not know what to do.</p>
  <p>With hindsight, I can see clearly that I was wholly unprepared. But that was not something I wished to admit to myself, in my vigorous youth. Living as I did in a fool's paradise, I thought there was nothing I could not achieve. In spite of my perplexity, I was confident I could find some use for a glut of leeks before they began, as cruel nature demanded, to rot.</p>
  <p>I tried out various schemes, some seemingly sensible, others wild and unhinged. No matter what I did, I was making no serious depredations to the glut. The leeks I had were countless, so I did not attempt to count them. The glut remained a glut.</p>
  <p>Then, one day, I received news of an impending visit from my spiritual adviser, lifestyle coach, and tobogganing partner, the dwarf Crepusco. Heaven forfend, I thought, that he should have to fight his way through a glut of leeks simply to reach the armchair I reserved for him anent the radiator. (Crepusco suffered dreadfully from the cold.) Thus it was that I cobbled together a sort of pulley system and hoisted each and every leek in the glut up from the floor so it dangled from the ceiling.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, so low was my ceiling in that place at that time, that I, being taller than a dwarf, found myself, when standing, in the midst of dangling vertical leeks. My vision was occluded, and I had to jostle my way through them blindly. No such terrors for the dwarf Crepusco, who sailed past me, sat himself in the armchair, and, as I had hoped he would, dispensed advice.</p>
  <p>“As your spiritual adviser,” he said, “I have nothing to say. As your tobogganing partner, I note we are due to make a run down a mighty crevasse next Thursday. And as your lifestyle coach, let me just say that I am deeply impressed by your innovative interior design initiative. A room with hanging leeks in profusion is both piquant and leeky, and is that not a combination anyone sensitive to interior design would kill for?”</p>
  <p>I blundered against the dado rail, doing myself a mischief, but I had to acknowledge his wisdom.</p>
  <p>Some while later, of course, the leeks did rot, but by then I had made a name for myself as a piquant and leeky interior designer, and I never looked back.</p>
