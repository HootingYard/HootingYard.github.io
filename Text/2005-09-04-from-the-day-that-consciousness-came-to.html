  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“From the day that consciousness came to me in this world I have been miserable… Too well do I know what it is to feel the burning and jagged links of the devil's chain cutting through my quivering flesh to the shrinking bone—to feel my nerves tremble with agony, and my brain burn as if bathed in liquids of fire—too well, I say, do I know what these things are, for I have felt them intensified again and again, ten thousand times.” — Luther Benson, <em>Fifteen Years In Hell</em></p>
