  <p>Christopher Frew's letter in today's <em>Guardian</em> is worthy of note:</p>
  <p><em>I am sure professional broadcasters will have many stories to tell of Charles Wheeler, but my favourite dates from the defection of Kim Philby at the height of the cold war (Obituaries, July 5). Wheeler was asked whether he was surprised at Philby's treason. “Not really,” replied Wheeler, “I never really trusted him. He was the sort of fellow who … smiled at breakfast, that sort of thing.” A great loss, fondly remembered.</em></p>
