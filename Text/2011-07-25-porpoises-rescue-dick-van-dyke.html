  <p>It has become common in recent years for the annual Hooting Yard paperback to be published in late autumn. This year, however, Mr Key has decided to tap the summer reading market. Now you can sprawl on the beach at a dilapidated and unseemly seaside resort clutching this fantastic new anthology to your heaving bosom!</p>

  <p><em>Porpoises Rescue Dick Van Dyke</em> contains 250 pages of majestic sweeping paragraphs, together with discussion notes for your Book Group and a photograph of the Parp-O-Phone! It even has wider margins than earlier books, so you won't need to crack the spine to sup your fill of what one critic (Snigsby) called “Mr Key's delicious prose nectar”.</p>
