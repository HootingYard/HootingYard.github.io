  <h1 id="post-1860">Beatnik Beerpint</h1>
  <p>Never one to be troubled by the chronology of cultural fads, poet Dennis Beerpint is trying to reinvent himself as a beatnik. He has been seen about town sporting a goatee beard and a jet black polo neck sweater. A concerned Beerpint-watcher suspects a copy of Allen Ginsberg's <em>Howl</em> may have fallen into his hands.</p>
  <p>“Knowing Dennis Beerpint,” writes my correspondent, “His version of <em>Howl</em> will probably be called <em>Bleat</em> or <em>Oooh, Missus!</em>”</p>
  <p>This seems a bit harsh to me. Though Beerpint can be incorrigibly twee, and often fatuous, at its best his work has reduced me to a sincerely sobbing heap of woebane. I am thinking of such pieces as <em>Lines Upon The Collision Of A Little Peewit With A Hot Air Balloon</em>, a poem I consider to be the finest peewit-related poem of the last millennium. It will be interesting to see where he goes in his new beatnik persona, daddy-o. Well, perhaps not interesting, but at the very least mildly diverting in a Beerpinty way for those of us who follow his doings.</p>
