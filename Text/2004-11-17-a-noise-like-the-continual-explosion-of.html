  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“A noise like the continual explosion of petards, another like the falling of a large animal against his bedroom door, another noise like spirit raps, and shrieks were heard by Father H.; no one else then heard them. Father H. heard them for eight nights, and not on the ninth. As a priest, he was probably a good deal alone, and had to walk over to a cottage behind a belt of wood to the eastward, where the retreat of the nuns he attended to was held. According to the average experience of Miss Freer's party, he would only have been attacked on about two days.” — John Harris, <em>Inferences From Haunted Houses And Haunted Men</em></p>
