  <h1>Quote of the Day</h1>
  <p>“Archer's hopes sank. It was easy to guess what had happened. Those thugs had found him, probably after the cyclotron had been turned off and before the physicists had come. They had assumed he was dead, and had taken the briefcase. Suddenly Archer remembered that he had had a broken arm. He lifted his right arm and clenched his hand. It certainly wasn't broken now. Then he stared at his hand. It glowed with a dull violet light.” — E A Grosser, <em>The Radiant Avenger</em></p>
