  <p><strong>M</strong> Maid Fainting</p>
  <p>For the millions of Americans who were newly affluent in 1925 but not affluent enough to afford a fainting maid that they could attend to came the Maid Fainting Society Inc of America.&nbsp; Bonded in 15 states, MFSA sponsored overseas maids to faint in good American homes.&nbsp; They were hired out at $4/hour (a handsome hourly sum in 1925), the fainting maids being allowed to keep half.&nbsp; In 1926 a sub-cult of Extra-Tall Fainting Maids was born (an example of which is pictured above), and provided an income to thousands for several years.&nbsp; (One of the last silent films ever made, <em>Fainting Maid Maiden</em>, with Clara Bow, 1944, used this phenomenon as a basis for its story; by that time however the craze had passed, the war was on, and no one cared any more for silent films about fainting maids.)</p>
