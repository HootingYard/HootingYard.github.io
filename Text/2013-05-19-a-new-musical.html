  <p>You can learn many things by watching the Eurovision Song Contest. I noted some of them the other day at <strong><em><a href="http://thedabbler.co.uk/2013/05/take-your-priest-to-eurovision-day/" class="external">The Dabbler</a></em></strong>, but here I wish to confess that it was only when watching Eurovision that I learned to pronounce Malmö correctly. I had always thought that the final <em>ö</em> rhymed with <em>dough</em>. Now I know that it is more accurately a sort of <em>er</em> or <em>uh</em> sound.</p>
  <p>This new knowledge led me, by ways I will not bother to explain, to devise a plan for an exciting piece of musical theatre. Now, I have not studied the life and times of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi with any great diligence, nor indeed with any diligence at all. What I know of the late tyrant was picked up from news reports—print and broadcast—over the years. So I have no idea whether he ever paid a visit to Sweden. If he did not, it does not matter, for my musical can be wholly fictional.</p>
  <p>The basic premise of my all-singing all-dancing show is that Gaddafi, on a visit to Sweden's southern capital, is presented by the good burghers of Malmö with an offering of myrrh. I realise this has connotations of the baby Jesus being presented with myrrh—plus gold and frankincense—by the three Kings of <strong><a href="2013-05-04-away-in-a-manger.html" class="internal" title="Away In A Manger">Orion-Tar</a></strong>, and that as a result my show might be accused of blasphemy. Well, bring it on!, as they say. We are all aware that blasphemy is a splendid way to drum up publicity. And Christian blasphemy is nice and safe, and wins plaudits for being “edgy” from the <em>Guardian</em>, unlike blasphemy against Islam, which gets you blown up or beheaded and accused of being racist by the <em>Guardian</em>.</p>
  <p>The main—the only—reason I have devised this show, however, is as a pretext for the title <em>Muammar's Malmö Myrrh</em>. That has a pleasing ring, does it not? The great thing about it is that, however clearly and resoundingly you try to enunciate the words, you still sound like a toothless inarticulate wretch.</p>
