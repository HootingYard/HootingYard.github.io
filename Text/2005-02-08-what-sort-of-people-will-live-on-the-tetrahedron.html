  <h1>What Sort of People Will Live on the Tetrahedron?</h1>
  <p>That question is the subtitle of an article in the May 1918 issue of <em>My Magazine</em>. Here are the opening paragraphs:</p>
  <p><em>How would you like to live on a tetrahedron? Men say the earth will one day come to that.</em></p>
  <p><em>Many strange visions men have had of the world since it began. They used to think it a disc floating in water. There are still stupid people who believe it is flat. Every wise child knows that the truth is that the earth is practically a round ball.</em></p>
  <p><em>It will not always be like this, however…what the people of the world will live on in millions of years to come will probably be a tetrahedron. It all looks terribly dull, but it is really tremendously interesting… Let us think about it all.</em></p>
  <p>I adore that well-placed “probably”, and it's a bit rich for a tetrahedron-earther to call a flat-earther “stupid”, but look, look!</p>

  <p>This is how it will be, and you can read further details <a class="external" href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/forgottenfutures/tetra/tetra.htm">here</a>. What you cannot read, maddeningly, is the answer to the question that is posed. I for one want to know what sort of people will live on the tetrahedron. Muggletonians? Quakers? Management consultants? Will they use the Mayan calendar? Will the Pope still wear a little white cap? Will the novels of V S Naipaul be in print? Hooting Yard's indefatigable Antipodean researcher Glyn Webster brought this to my attention. Perhaps he could do the decent thing and answer the question.</p>
