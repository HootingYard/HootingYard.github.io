  <h1 id="post-199">Rummaging In An Abandoned Satchel</h1>
  <p>The other day I had <a href="2007-06-05-drink-ye-every-one-the-waters-of-his-own-cistern-until-i-come-and-take-you-away.html" class="internal" title="Drink Ye Every One The Waters Of His Own Cistern, Until I Come And Take You Away">some harsh words</a> to say about the out of print pamphleteer Dobson's song-writing skills. “No one with any sense has ever listened to a Dobson song more than once”, I wrote. Well, it seems I was mistaken. I was rummaging in a satchel that I found abandoned on a canal towpath, and I came upon indisputable evidence that at least one sensible person admired a Dobson song so much that they recorded a cover version of it. The song in question is one of the pamphleteer's settings from the <em>Book of Isaiah</em>.</p>
  <p>Hooting Yard readers are a wise bunch, and I would not be surprised to be deluged with letters accusing me of making up the whole satchel-rummaging incident in some foolhardy attempt to chivvy up Dobson's reputation. I therefore arranged for a local snapper to take a snapshot of what I found, as proof.</p>

  <p>am now going to have to go and lie down in a darkened, cork-panelled room while I mull over what this extraordinary artefact tells us about (a) Dobson, and (b) Tiny Enid.</p>
