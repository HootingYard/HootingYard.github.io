  <h1>Crime of the Century</h1>
  <p>That beacon of common sense and moderation, the Reverend Ian Paisley, described the recent £22 million <a class="external" href="http://news.scotsman.com/uk.cfm?id=21492005">bank robbery</a> in Northern Ireland as “the crime of the century”. Things bode well for the next ninety-five years, then.</p>
  <p>His comment set me thinking about the crime of the century just gone, so I went to Google to have a look. There were 65,800 results, but I was able to discount the majority of these because they referred to songs by Shania Twain and Supertramp. (On second thoughts… maybe those titles were accurately self-referential.) Anyway, the usual suspects were predictably present—JFK, the Lindbergh baby kidnapping<span class="asterisk">*</span>, Leopold and Loeb, Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, and more recently the so-called “war on terror” and the destruction of the rainforest—but I was more interested in the less celebrated misdeeds which had been described as “the crime of the century”. These included:</p>
  <p>Government advice that people should take mineral and vitamin supplements</p>
  <p>The demolition of a building in Missouri as part of the US Custom House &amp; Post Office Project</p>
  <p>An eight-inch crawdad deposited in someone's grandmother's rain barrel</p>
  <p>The recent Ukrainian elections. A Yanukovich supporter said of Yuschenko's “coup”: “This is the crime of the century—worse than Hitler, worse than Chernobyl. This is a battle to Armageddon. It's a battle between the Antichrist and Christian peoples. They are turning people into orange zombies… all of them have abnormal sexual energy.”</p>
  <p>Theft of an item of sporting memorabilia from Geelong Football Club</p>
  <p>Publication of the Kinsey reports, <em>Sexual Behaviour in the Human Male</em> (1948) and <em>Sexual Behaviour in the Human Female</em> (1953). The perpetrator of this crime of the century is denounced as the “patriarch of perversion”</p>
  <p>Something I don't quite understand about cold fusion theories, to wit: “The hot fusioneers have made a fundamental error in judgment. Because they are so thoroughly skilled in gas plasma physics, where light-element fusion can and does occur, they have expected that any fusion in an electrochemical cell, on or near the surface of a metal lattice, must be similar to fusion in a gas plasma. The only way these scientists could have been more seriously in error would be to condemn the discovery of cold fusion, which some did!”</p>
  <p>The proposed sale of the KPFA radio station by its parent company, the Pacifica Foundation</p>
  <p>The theft, from a photo shoot in the South of France, of an advance copy of an album by a pop group called U2.</p>

  <p><span class="mark">*NOTE&nbsp;:</span> It should be well-known by now that eerie fascist Charles Lindbergh accidentally killed his child during a prank.
