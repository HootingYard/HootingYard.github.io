  <p>Over at ResonanceFM there is another fundraising auction. This time bids are invited for two ancient books by Mr Key, <em>House Of Turps</em> and the ludicrously rare <em>The Brink Of Cramp</em>. Both of these were published in the year that Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe, although that may be purely coincidental. For further details, and to make a bid, go <a href="http://forum.resonancefm.com/viewtopic.php?t=3205" class="external">here</a>. (You will need to join the Forum if you want to participate.)</p>
  <p>The money raised will go direct to ResonanceFM. Should you wish to add to Mr Key's own paltry coffers, you can of course buy <em>Befuddled By Cormorants</em> or make a donation. Simply click over there on the right.</p>
